Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Left hip pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ M presenting with atraumatic left hip and and low back pain 
worse with standing, relieved with rest, no trauma, no 
neurological symptoms, normal rectal tone, large left inguinal 
hernia, unable to reduce.  Unable to ambulate, so admitted.  He 
was evaluated by Gen Surgery in the ED, who felt the hernia was 
stable, and not related to current complaints.
. 
Pt states that the pain is severe, ___. There is pain 
localized L hip region, which starts L anterior pelvis at 
midline, and wraps around pelvis to posterior L spine.  Pain 
worse with leg movement.  Sharp. Relieved somewhat with rest.  
Pt also notes history of bilateral leg pain, which starts at 
hips and radiates downt to feet B; does not have currently, and 
pt unable to describe if similar pain to hip pain, or if similar 
onset.  Pt does note that the leg pain improves when leaning 
over a shopping cart.  Pt is unclear if the hip pain improves 
with this as well, as he has been unable to ambulate.
.
Of note, multiple phone calls logged in on Epic.  ___, called 
complaining of shortness of breath as well as ? rib vs chest 
pain.  Earlier, called about hip pain.  ___, called about 
chalky feeling in throat and difficulty walking as well as cold 
extremities; was advised to suck on candy and push fluids. He 
was seen by PCP ___ ___ for hip pain.  The PCP noted that the 
pain might be due to decreased exercise and recommended that 
patient start to exercise more.  Hip film ordered but never 
performed.  
.
Pt also notes significant SOB, DOE, 3 pillow orthopnea (same as 
prior), and increased weight gain recently.  He states his dry 
weight is 274-275, and states more recently has been 285-286.  
He states he drinks ""a lot of water"", but has difficulty 
quatifying.  Estimated a little more than a liter, but this 
estimate is suspect.  States he reads labels, and eats low 
sodium, but does not add numbers to ensure <2gm/day.  He uses 
CPAP, but is not religious about it, and states he tries to use 
it for 6 hrs per night, but it is unclear if he is successful in 
this goal.

Pertinent Results:
CT L-spine (___):
1. No acute fx or malalignment of the L spine. 
2. A small pocket of air in the retroperitoneal space next to 
the spine at 
T11 (image 4:1), incompletely imaged and of uncertain etiology. 
Could 
represent vaccum gas phenomenon. Recommend clinical 
correlations.
RADIOLOGY ATTENDING ADDENDUM
There is some degree of spinal stenosis at L4-5. The severity is 
difficult to evaluate due to overlying artifacts, but it is 
potentially severe. This appears to be due to a combination of 
disk bulging, perhaps protrusion, and facet joint osteophytes. 
MR may be helpful if further evaluation is indicated. There is a 
small collection of gas in the spinal canal on the right, just 
below the L4-5 interspace. This suggests a disk protrusion in 
this location, atlhought there is not sufficient soft tissue 
contrast to fully evaluate it. There is bulging of the disk at 
L5-S1 without evidence of a protrusion. Again, image quality is 
limited and MR may be helpful. 
 
CT Pelvis (___):
1. Large L inguinal hernia, with a loop of bowel in the sac. No 
evidence of obstruction. 
2. bony pelvis noted with DJD, but no acute fx. 

Hip and L-spine X RAY ___: 
No acute fracture or dislocation. Please refer to the concurrent 

CT pelvis for additional findings of a large left inguinal 
hernia. 

Echo (___):
CONCLUSIONS
1. The left ventricle size is normal. There is mild concentric 
left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is low-normal, with an estimated LVEF of 50-55 %. There 
is septal flattening in systole which is consistent with right 
ventricular pressure overload.
2. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
3. The right ventricle is moderately enlarged.  The right 
ventricular systolic function is moderately impaired.
4. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
5. There is mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation present. 
Estimated PA systolic pressure, calculated from peak TR 
velocity,  is 53 mmHg above RA pressure.
6. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images 
reviewed) of ___, right heart findings are worse. However, with 
retrospective review of the prior study (which has even more 
limited imaging of the rightheart than the present study), there 
is probably some early and mild abnormalities of the right 
heart.

___ ECHO 
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is 
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is considerable 
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection 
fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. The right 
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall 
contractility. There is abnormal diastolic septal 
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume 
overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and 
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Atrial fibrillation making evaluation of ventricular 
function challenging. Mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional left ventricular 
systolic function. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with 
evidence of volume overload.  

CHEST X RAY PA/LAT ___: 
Findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema and small left 

pleural effusion in the setting of cardiomegaly. Recommend 
repeat radiograph after diuresis. 

CHEST X RAY AP PORTABLE ___: 
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of ___, there is little 
overall 
change. Bibasilar atelectasis persists with enlargement of the 
cardiac 
silhouette in a patient with low lung volumes. Some left pleural 
effusion may well be present. However, no definite pulmonary 
edema is appreciated. 
Of incidental note is an azygos fissure, of no clinical 
significance.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o male who presented with atraumatic left hip, left low 
back, and occassional bilateral lower extremity pain worse with 
standing and without neurological symptoms likely due to spinal 
stenosis who was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. 

Hypoxia / acute on chronic diastolic CHF:  Patient presented 
with a new oxygen requirement, satting 94% on 3L NC with 
bilateral rales on exam and a reported 10 lb weight gain over 
his dry weight with concern for pulmonary edema. CXR revealed 
moderate pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion in the 
setting of cardiomegaly, BNP was > 3000. He ruled out for an MI, 
his repeat echocardiogram revealed a normal EF and mild LVH.  
The patient was initially doing well on the floor early in his 
admission. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia 
related to worsening pulmonary edema.  In addition the patient 
was diuresed and developed a contraction alkylosis, and he was 
treated with diamox to help correct this.  He was given 
agressive potassium repletion during diuresis and his potassium 
remained at 3.1 upon discharge.  He was discharged home at his 
dry weight of 175 lbs, had a room air O2 sat of 97% and a 
ambulatory O2 sat on room air of 91%.  He was ambulating well 
but will get home ___, and given his admission for heart failure 
he was referred for tele health to help with diuretic management 
should he gain greater than 3 pounds above his dry weight.  He 
was continued on his beta blocker and his home dose of lasix 
120mg po bid.  His obstructive sleep apnea is likely a dominant 
cause in his R heart failure related to moderate pulmonary 
hypertension and is treated with CPAP.

Back and Leg pain: CT demonstrated mild degenerative changes in 
the pelvis but no fractures.  He was noted to have spinal 
stenosis. Patient received Tylenol standing and Oxycodone PRN 
for breakthrough pain. ___ consult was also provided. Pain and 
mobility improved.  Given the improvement in his symptoms he was 
treated conservatively however an MRI of the spine is indicated 
as an outpatient to further assess for severity of spinal 
stenosis.

Obstructive sleep apnea: Patient was maintained on CPAP at 
night. 

Atrial Fibrillation: Patient was on Metoprolol for rate control 
and Warfarin for anti-coagulation at home. INR was therapeutic 
on admission, was down to 1.5 on discharge, he was given 7.5mg 
po x 1 on ___ then continued on 6.25mg po daily until his 
follow up on ___ with his PCP and warfarin dosing can be 
adjusted.  

Peripheral vascular disease: Patient was on Aspirin at home and 
was continued throughout hospitalization. 

Hypertension: Patient was continued on Metoprolol and Lasix. 

Coronary Artery Disease: Continued on Aspirin and Metoprolol per 
above. 

History of Melanoma and Squamous Cell Cancer: No known current 
recurrence.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have a right periprosthetic fracture and was admitted to the 
orthopedic surgery service. The patient was taken to the 
operating room on the for ORIF right periprosthetic femur 
fracture, which the patient tolerated well. For full details of 
the procedure please see the separately dictated operative 
report. The patient was taken from the OR to the PACU in stable 
condition. Her PACU course was notable for a prolonged stay due 
to inability to wean off phenylephrine which subsequently 
resolved with fluid resuscitation. The patient was initially 
given IV fluids and IV pain medications, and progressed to a 
regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. The patient was 
given ___ antibiotics and anticoagulation per 
routine. The patient's home medications were continued 
throughout this hospitalization. The patient worked with ___ who 
determined that discharge to rehab was appropriate. 

The medicine service was consulted for preoperative evaluation 
and continue to follow her after surgery.

Patient had anemia with hematocrits below 24 postoperatively, 
and was transfused several units per geriatrics protocol (1u 
pRBC on ___, 1u pRBC on ___, and 1u pRBC on ___. She had 
an appropriate and robust response in her hematocrit and 
remained hemodynamically stable with no evidence of bleeding on 
exam.

Some asymmetric lower extremity swelling was noted, right 
greater than left, and patient subsequently went for an 
ultrasound of her right lower extremity which showed no evidence 
of DVT.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the

Non-Contrast Head CT (___) :
Preliminary Report FINDINGS:  
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage,acute infarction, mass 
or midline shift. There is no hydrocephalus. The ventricles and 
sulci are enlarged consistent with atrophy. There are 
periventricular white matter hypodensities most consistent with 
sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. In the left 
frontal lobe, along the convexity is an extraaxial soft tissue 
density lesion adjacent to the calvarium which is remodeled. 
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. 
There is no fracture. 
Preliminary Report IMPRESSION:  
No acute intracranial process. 

Head Neck CTA (___):
There is no large vessel occlusion, dissection, or aneurysm > 3 
mm.  
Multifocal atherosclerotic calcifications are seen predominantly 
within the bilateral common carotid arteries at the bifurcation 
and within the bilateral carotid siphons. The carotid and 
vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent with no 
evidence of stenoses. The left vertebral artery is noted to be 
dominant. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
- Transient left facial weakness, thought to be TIA, though 
unable to obtain MRI due to pacemaker. CTA did not show 
significant atherosclerosis, but stroke work up labs showed 
significant hyperlipidemia with LDL of 170. 
- Pt developed leukocytosis while in the hospital, but afebrile 
and clinically appearing well, no evidence of UA or pneumonia. 
Should be repeated as outpatient within 1 week.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left facial droop 
resulting from a transient ischemic attack, a condition in which 
a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
transiently blocked and causes symptoms. The brain is the part 
of your body that controls and directs all the other parts of 
your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its 
blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.

TIA can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
- hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol)
- high blood pressure
- atrial fibrillation

We are changing your medications as follows:
- START atorvastatin 20 mg daily 
- START fish oil supplements twice a day

Please take your other medications as prescribed. 
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- sudden weakness of one side of the body
- sudden drooping of one side of the face
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
- sudden difficulty pronouncing words (slurring of speech)
- sudden blurring or doubling of vision
- sudden onset of vertigo (sensation of your environment 
spinning around you)
- sudden clumsiness of the arm and leg on one side or sudden 
tendency to fall to one side (left or right)
- sudden severe headache accompanied by the inability to stay 
awake
It was a pleasure providing you with care during this 
hospitalization.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

projecting over the right upper lung, not clearly seen on the 
prior study. Recommend outpatient chest CT for further 
evaluation for concerning pulmonary nodule. 

MRI C/T/L spine negative for epidural abscess.

TTE ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF 70%). The right ventricular free wall 
thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated with normal free wall contractility. There are focal 
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate 
bileaflet mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly 
directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least 
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
IMPRESSION: no vegetations seen (best excluded by TEE). If 
clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D 
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.Compared with the 
prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the mitral 
regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are both worse. 

TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the 
body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the 
right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion without 
vegetation or abscess. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is 
mild posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.There is prominent 
mitral annular calcification with no obvious signs of 
endocarditis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen there is no 
tricuspid valve vegetation or abscess. There is no pericardial 
effusion. IMPRESSION: No clear valve vegetations or abscess 
seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE: ___ F with minimal past medical history (HTN, 
mild MR, TR) who presented with sepsis and was found to have 
high grade MSSA bacteremia. A source was never identified and 
she was treated with cefazolin, with plans to complete a four 
week course. After being fluid resuscitated for ___ sepsis she 
developed rapid atrial fibrillation and recurrent flash 
pulmonary edema. She was found to have new severe MR and TR, 
without vegetations on the valves, and with dilated atria 
suggesting a chronic process. She was transfered to the 
cardiology service and then to medicine for management. She was 
in decompensated heart failure and diuresed with good effect.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Sepsis: Presented with fevers, lethargy, SIRS physiology, WBC 
count 23 with neutrophilic predominance. Blood cultures grew 
MSSA. No source was ever identified. MRI of the C/T/L spine was 
performed given recent history of epidural injections, and was 
negative for an abscess. First negative cultures ___.  She was 
initially treated broadly, subsequently narrowed to IV 
Cefazolin, with plans to complete a four week course (to end on 
___, and follow up with ID before completion. 

#Afib:  After ___ L fluid resuscitation initially, found to be 
in rapid Atrial fibrillation, HR 140-160, asymptomatic. Systolic 
pressures in the ___. Systolic pressures dropped significant 
with IV nodal agents, though she maintained normal mentation. 
Additional IV fluid was administered and she was transferred to 
the MICU for cardioversion. Once in the MICU, she converted 
spontaneously. ___ rates were subsequently controlled with 
standing oral diltiazem, and pushes of 15 mg diltiazem IV for 
heart rates>140. ___ blood pressures subsequently remained 
stable.  She subequently remained in Afib and was asymptomatic 
with rates ___. No cardioversion was attempted given that 
the Afib was felt ___ dilated L atrium from ___ severe MR, and 
she was unlikely to remain stably in sinus. She will continue to 
take diltiazem SR 240 mg and warfarin 2 mg daily. 

#Severe mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, 
congestive heart failure: After copious fluid resuscitation 
during sepsis and rapid Afib, patient developed acute shortness 
of breath. CXR with pulmonary edema. TTE revealed severe 4+ MR 
and TR with MVP, new since ___.  ___ ruled out vegetations 
and confirmed the findings. Dilated atria on ECHO  and pulmonary 
hypertension suggest that ___ valvular lesions had been present 
for some time. LVEF was 70%, but this may have been 
significantly overestimated given the degree of MR. ___ 
shortness of breath and pulmonary edema were precipitated by 
copious fluid resuscitation increasing ___ left atrial 
pressures.  She developed pitting edema to the mid thigh on exam 
and had cool hands and feet and a lactate >3, findings suggested 
of decompensated heart failure. She was transferred to a 
cardiology service where a strategy of diuresis and afterload 
reduction (Captopril) was undertaken, with dramatic improvement 
in ___ symptoms, clinical examination, and lab evidence of 
global tissue perfusion.
     She was initially seen by cardiac surgery who felt ___ to 
not currently be candidate for surgery because of poor 
nutritional status, weight 91 lbs. She will continue to take 
torsemide 20 mg daily and captopril 25 mg TID with strict fluid 
monitoring, with daily weights, and ins and outs. She will 
optimize ___ nutritional status, consuming meals with 
supplementation. While medically stable, lactate has ranged from 
1.4 to 3.4. If lactate increases past 4, she will require 
adjustment in afterload reduction with captopril and more 
diuresis. 

# Patient was found to be severely malnourished with weight 
91lbs, per nutrition consult noted to have improving po intake 
and receiving encouragement from family. At discharge, patient 
had 3 meals yesterday w/ snacks w/ intake varying from
50-100% of meals. Encouraged patient to have 3 meals per day and 
discussed incorporating ___ high calorie snacks like nuts, 
custard, peanut butter in between meals to increase calories. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Encourage 3 meals w/ ___ snacks per day and at least 75% 
intake at all meals
- Monitor Chem10 and replete lytes prn
- Monitor I/O's and weight

#Hypocalcemia: Not an active issue during this hospitalization. 
-Vit D, PTH to be checked as outpatient.

#Spiculated nodule RUL: given history of weight loss, concerning 
for lung cancer. However, do not feel this is contributing to 
___ current presentaiton.
-F/u CAT scan as outpatient in 3 months 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-complete cefazolin on ___
-please follow up with ID - before completion of cefazolin 
-please get daily LFTs, daily lactate, electrolytes every other 
day
-Continue torsemide 20mg daily with adjustment based on 
continual assessment of volume status, dry weight 41.5kg. ___ 
call cardiac services ___, NP ___ for 
questions regarding volume status.
-spiculated nodule RUL noted on imaging; CT scan needed as an 
outpatient in 3 months to follow up
-follow up with cardiac surgery in 3 weeks - ___ at 1:45PM Dr. 
___ ___
-follow up with cardiac services on ___ 
-Requires sustained nutritional support with supplements, with 
understanding that dry weight may incrase with increased calorie 
intake.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M with PMHx of 
well-controlled HIV, thrombocytopenia, urinary retention due to 
neurogenic bladder, dyslipidemia and cardiomyopathy (EF 30%) who 
presented to the ED with fevers and malaise, found to have 
morulae on blood parasite smear consistent with acute 
anaplasmosis infection.

# Probable Anaplasmosis infection:
# Fevers:
Blood smear positive for anaplasmosis as most likely etiology of 
fever. He was started on doxycycline with a plan to complete a 
10-day course through ___. While in the hospital, he was also 
continued on antibiotics to treat a complicated UTI diagnosed 
the week prior to this admission. He completed a total 7d course 
of antibiotics, switched to ciprofloxacin during this hospital 
stay due to concerns that cephalosporins can cause 
thrombocytopenia.

# Acute on chronic thrombocytopenia:
Thrombocytopenia known since ___ (pt says as low as 25) and 
initially thought to be ___ irbesartan, which was discontinued. 
Thrombocytopenia has persisted and was acutely worse this 
hospitalization with a nadir of 19.  Thrombocytopenia suspected 
to be worsened in setting of acute infection vs. side effect of 
cephalosporins started 1 week PTA to treat UTI.  Hematology was 
consulted.  He was transfused 1 unit of platelets.  With 
treatment of the anaplasma infection and/or switch to 
ciprofloxacin for UTI treatment, platelets improved to his 
baseline (40s) at the time of discharge.  He was continued on 
home prednisone 10 mg daily (started for possible ITP in 
outpatient setting).  He will follow-up with our Hematologists 
for further monitoring and treatment.  

# Acute kidney injury:
Cr 1.5 at admission, from 0.90 at ___ last week. Presumed 
pre-renal. Improved with gentle IVF.

# Neurogenic bladder:
Stable. Patient self-catheterizes. Urologist is at ___.

# HIV:
Last CD4 in our system was 521 with undetectable viral load. 
Follows with Dr. ___. Continued home ARVs.  Reepeat HIV 
viral load and CD4 count were pending at the time of discharge.

# CAD:
# Chronic systolic CHF (EF previously ___, presumed 
ischemic:
Prior cardiac cath in ___ (do not have results). Had nuc 
stress test in ___ which showed fixed defect consistent with 
prior infarct.  He is not on ASA d/t low plt, risk of bleeding.  
Continued home pravastatin, metoprolol.  Home enalapril was held 
in the setting ___ and infection.

# Atrial fibrillation/flutter:
New diagnosis last week at ___.  Likely provoked by acute 
infection and fevers. Currently well rate-controlled on 
metoprolol. Not on AC due to low platelets. 

# Anal dysplasia: 
ASCUS on recent pap ___. Plan for HRA at ___ while
in ___.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] HIV viral load, CD4 count sent with results pending at time 
of discharge
[] Anaplasma PCR and babesia PCR sent, with results pending at 
discharge
[] Consider initiation of anticoagulation for newly diagnosed 
atrial fibrillation if platelet counts improve (not started on 
AC due to thrombocytopenia)

=================
#. Acute on chronic sCHF exacerbation: EF ___ based on MIBI, 
last TTE was performed in ___ showed 45-50%. In ___, he had a 
HIV and HCV negative, and normal TSH, Ferritin, ___. It is most 
likely an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy at this point, 
potentially related to HTN. He underwent Right and left heart 
cath on admission. His wedge pressure was 28 on cardiac cath. He 
had no obstructing coronary lesions on LHC and no interventions 
were performed. Precipitating event most likely is uncontrolled 
hypertension, but there is concern for medication noncompliance

Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___. 

You came to the hospital and had a procedure called a cardiac 
catheterization to look at the blood vessels around your heart. 
You do not have any blockages in those arteries.

Your shortness of breath most likely was from your heart being 
weak causing you to retain fluid. We removed the extra fluid 
with a diuretics through your IV. Your symptoms improved, you 
were discharged with a diuretic called torsemide which you can 
take by mouth. Please take potassium daily and have your kidney 
function and potassium checked on ___.  

It is important to weigh yourself every morning and record it in 
a book. If your weight increases by more than 3 pounds in one 
day you should call your doctor. If you start to feel dizzy or 
are losing weight, also call your doctor because your torsemide 
dose might be too high.

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis in setting of 
radiation treatment.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
This is an ___ man with a history of DM II, HTN, AS 
(valve area 1.1), medium-vessel vasculitis and seronegative 
arthritis (on prednisone and hydroxy-chloroquine), 
3-vessel-disease (LM 70%, Mid LAD 60%, Ramus mild disease, OM1 
100%, Distal RCA 100%.) awaiting CABG, and atypical 
fibroxanthoma of the nose requiring radiation who presents to ED 
with chest pain, shortness of breath, and vomiting during 
radiation treatment.  Mr. ___ was subsequently transferred 
to the MICU with low BP, melena, Hct drop, ST depressions in 
V3-V6, and elevated troponin.  In ED, CXR showed new mild 
pulmonary edema, moderate right pleural effusion, mild 
cardiomegaly, L>R bibasilar atelectasis.
.
Cardiology consult in the ICU concluded that elevated troponins 
were likely reflective of demand ischemia/NSTEMI rather than 
plaque rupture.  Cardiac symptoms occurred in setting of 
pulmonary edema and anemia, putting added strain on an already 
diseased heart.  Mr. ___ could not be started on a heparin 
drip due to nasal bleeding and melena.
.
Patient was transfused 3 units of blood in the ICU and responded 
appropriately (went from 23.9-->29).  It was thought that anemia 
was most likely the result of a slow nasal bleed rather than an 
acute GI bleed.  Although held initially in light of bleed and 
low BP, patient was eventually continued on ASA, statin, plavix, 
BB, and ___.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, patient was in good spirits.  His 
cardiac enzymes were trending down and EKG changes were 
resolving.  Vitals on transfer were: T: 98.7, HR: 64, BP: 
126/55, 94% on RA.
.
ROS:  Patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills or any other 
concerning symptom.
 
Past Medical History:

___:
Interstitial pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural 
effusions.  The study and the report were reviewed by the staff 
radiologist. 

CTA:
1. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta, 
iliac 
vessels, and throughout both lower extremities, as outlined 
above.
2. No vascular wall thickening or perivascular edema to suggest 
vasculitis.  No central arterial thrombi.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

with hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and 
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally 
(LVEF = 45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta and aortic arch are 
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 
1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ gentleman with multiple medical problems 
including 3-vessel CAD awaiting CABG, bleeding nasal tumor, and 
DM II who was admitted to ___ for demand ischemia vs. NSTEMI 
in the setting of low hematocrit and hypotension.
.
#CAD:  Mr. ___ has severe 3-vessel disease and is awaiting 
CABG (and AVR) however, surgery has been delayed in light of 
bleeding nasal tumor.  Patient will need to be on high doses of 
heparin during bypass, thus it is imperative to wait until tumor 
has shrunk and is less likely to bleed.  Mr. ___ was 
admitted to the hospital after complaining of chest pain, SOB, 
and diaphoresis during a radiation treatment.  He was found to 
have ST depressions in V3-V6, elevated troponins, drop in hct, 
and low BP.  It was felt that this was demand ischemia in 
context of anemia (slowly bleeding nasal tumor).  He was 
admitted to the MICU and transfused 3 units of blood (hct bumped 
appropriately).  After transfer to the floor, Mr. ___ was 
continued on ASA 325mg, high dose statin, and valsartan.  His 
metoprolol was switched to carvedilol 25mg bid for better blood 
pressure control.  Plavix was stopped in light of bleeding and 
in preparation for CABG.  Patient remained chest pain free 
throughout duration of admission.  He will follow up with Dr. 
___ on ___ for CABG evaluation and will see Dr. ___ 
outpatient cardiology management.
.
NASAL CANCER:  Mr. ___ with atypical fibroxanthoma 
diagnosed in ___.  Currently being treated by 
radiation-oncology; treatment was extended through ___ as tumor 
was slow to regress.  ENT and wound care specialists directed 
bandage changes.  Patient with follow-up with ENT as an 
outpatient.
.
SERONEGATIVE ARTHRITIS:  Patient carries a diagnosis of 
seronegative arthritis, managed by outpatient rheumatologist and 
seen at ___ rheumatology in ___.  He remained on 
hydroxychloroquine throughout admission.
.
MEDIUM VESSEL VASCULITIS:  Patient with painful leg ulcers, 
diagnosed as medium vessel vasculitis.  Mr. ___ 
prednisone was ___ to 60mgQD (from 20mgQD) upon 
discharge.  Dermatology and rheumatology were both consulted and 
gave their recommendations.  Patient will follow-up with both of 
these specialties as anoutpatient.  Pain was controlled with 
tylenol and oxycodone.
.
ANEMIA:  Most likely from slow but consistent nasal bleeding.  
Mr. ___ did not have any acute drops in hct during 
admission.  His hct was maintained at ~28 and received a total 
of 5 units of PRBCs throughout hospital stay.
.
CHF:  Patient appeared slightly volume overloaded on admission, 
but after diuresis remained euvolemic.  Patient was continued on 
home lasix 40mg QD and received prn lasix with blood 
transfusions.  He was maintained on ___, BB, and statin.  ECHO 
showed EF of 45%.  I's and O's were carefully monitored.
.
DELIRIUM:  Patient had one episode of delirium during admission 
at which time he reported ""being in a furniture store"" and 
seeing ""butterflies"" in the halls.  Mr. ___ had been 
wearing thick sunglasses (because of radiation conjunctivitis) 
and after these were removed, he remained lucid.  Efforts were 
made to orient patient and unnecessary medications and lines 
were removed.  Geriatrics was consulted for further 
recommendations.
.
HYPERTENSION:  BP was not well controlled on admission but 
improved with substitution of carvedilol for metoprolol and 
administration ___ at night.  Patient may need uptitration of 
BP meds in context of increase in prednisone.
.
DMII:  Patient was maintained on insulin sliding scale and NPH 
15AM/5PM.  Outpatient doses may need to be adjusted in context 
of increased prednisone.
.
GERD:  Ranitidine was continued at 150mg BID.
.
CONJUNCTIVITIS:  Secondary to radiation.  Patient was maintained 
on erythromycin OPH.

Imaging:
CTA Chest: 1.  There is an arguable filling defect in a 
subsegmental pulmonary artery in the region of the right lower 
lobe pneumonia, which may represent a small pulmonary embolism.  
If clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism remains high, 
recommend repeat CTA of the chest after treatment for pneumonia. 
2. Large, heterogeneous masses in the thyroid. Recommend 
nonemergent thyroid ultrasound for additional evaluation, if 
this has not already been performed. 3.  Massive cardiomegaly. 
4. Dense consolidations in the bilateral bases with air 
bronchograms, concerning for multifocal pneumonia.

CT sinus: Successful reduction of the temporomandibular joints 
bilaterally. Alignment appears anatomic. No fracture identified.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with ___ disease, CHF, HTN, recent bladder cancer 
resection (~1 week prior) who presents with jaw dislocation, 
subclavian vein thrombosis, hematuria.

# Jaw dislocation: 
Likely due to recent surgery and complication from anesthesia. 
She underwent reduction in the ED with apparent proper alignment 
per CT sinus. She is now tolerating modified diet without active 
aspiration (however, I am concerned about continued silent 
aspiration). She needs continued S+S evaluation.

# Subclavian vein DVT:
She was found to have subclavian vein DVT at OSH. She did not 
have a history of central catheter per patient/family. We 
attempted anticoagulation with heparin drip; however, this was 
complicated from hematuria with hematocrit drop. Anticoagulation 
was stopped as the risk of significant bleed was thought to 
outweigh the benefit of upper extremity DVT treatment. I 
discussed with patient and family and they agreed. If the 
hematuria resolved, anticoagulation can be considered in ___ 
weeks if clinically indicated.

# Hematuria, gross:
# Bladder mass:
This was likely due to recent surgical removal or bladder 
cancer. She had no visible hematuria after discontinuation of 
anticoagulation. She will need to follow up with urologist for 
results and further evaluation and management. After discussion 
with daughter (HCP), they would not opt for chemotherapy or 
other aggressive therapy at this point if continued malignancy. 
Cancer could explain some of her symptoms such as continued 
fatigue and anorexia. She will need to follow up with urology to 
determine final results of her bladder mass resection and to 
determine appropriate follow up therapy. Palliative care or 
hospice should be considered.

# Consolidation of chest CT:
This was likely due to aspiration. There was no evidence of 
active pneumonia based on WBC, O2 requirement, fevers, etc. She 
did have bibasilar crackles on exam. She was continued on 
levofloxacin (prescribed from prior bladder surgery) which was 
changed to Augmentin after she was noted to have achilles 
tendonitis. If she develops fevers, worsening SOB, etc, she may 
need HCAP treatment for likely aspiration pneumonia.

# Left achilles tenderness:
Likely due to fluoroquinolone. This was discontinued and she was 
started on Augmentin. Continue to work with ___.

# Deconditioning:
She has significant weakness. Likely from hospitalization and 
acute and chronic medical issues. She will need aggressive 
rehabilitation.

# Thyroid masses:

CXR ___: IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema.

ECHO ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal 
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which 
most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no 
major change.  

CXR ___: FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the 
cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and there is again 
indistinctness of mildly engorged pulmonary vessels consistent 
with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  No definite acute 
focal pneumonia. 

CXR ___: FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in 
this date, there is respiratory motion which degrades the image. 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence 
of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Poor definition of the 
hemidiaphragms could reflect some pleural effusions and 
compressive atelectasis.  No gross evidence of pneumonia or 
pneumothorax. 

CXR ___: FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of 
this date, there is an endotracheal tube with its tip at the 
clavicular level, approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  The 
degree of engorgement of pulmonary vessels is less than on the 
earlier study.  Atelectatic changes with a small effusion again 
seen on the left. 

CT Head w/out contrast ___: IMPRESSION: 1.  No acute 
intracranial abnormality. 2.  Pansinus inflammatory disease with 
high density material in left frontal sinus.  Some of these 
findings may be related to intubation. 

EEG ___: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal waking EEG because of 
frontally predominant background activity with diffuse slowing. 
These findings are indicative of mild to moderate encephalopathy 
of non-specific etiology. The frontal predominant background 
activity could be due to sedation effects, e.g. benzodiazepines. 


CXR ___: Since the prior chest x-ray of ___, there has been an 
apparent increase in the cardiac size and an increase in the 
vascular markings, particularly in the perihilar regions 
suggesting worsening interstitial failure. IMPRESSION:  
Worsening interstitial failure. 

CXR ___: PRELIMINARY REPORT: Comparison is made with prior 
study, ___. Moderate cardiomegaly is accentuated by the 
projection and low lung volumes. The aorta is tortuous and there 
is no evidence of volume overload in the current study. There is 
no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ yo female with a pmh history significant 
for diabetes, hypertension, and depression who was seen at her 
___ office with a week of worsening symptoms of shortness of 
breath. 
  
Active issues: 
#VIRAL PNEUMONIA: The overall story and clinical picture was 
felt to be concerning for heart failure. That said her BNP was 
wnl. There was no focal consolidations on her CXR, it is 
consistent with pulm edema. Influenza was ruled out with a 
negative flu swab. Other concerns include cardiac etiology, such 
as a missed event in this diabetic patient with a week of 
worsening symptoms, though her EKG is without signs of q-waves 
and trop is negative. Additional significant wheezing on exam 
was suggestive of possible bronchitis vs COPD like picture 
though she has never been formally diagnosed. She was diureses 
with IV lasix with some improvement. This was limited by both 
hypotension and acute renal failure.  ECHO was without evidence 
of systolic dysfunction.  She was also given nebulizer 
treatments. The patient initially improved and O2 was weaned. 
However on ___ shortness of breath became acutely worse 
with increasing O2 requirement.  CXR was unchanged.  She became 
increasingly less responsive over the course of the day. Vanc 
and zosyn were started for empiric coverage of a possible HAP.  
ABG demonstrated hypercarbia and she was intubated and 
transferred to the MICU. In the ICU the patient was treated for 
COPD exacerbation with steroids (though no documented history of 
COPD and is not a current/former smoker), she was treated for 
HCAP initially. She did very well and was extubated on ___ 
with improvement in her pCO2 to the ___ which appears to be 
patients baseline.  The ICU team suspects a component of obesity 
hyperventilation syndrome and OSA though this has never been 
formally diagnosed in the patient. CXR in the ICU showed no PNA 
but did show a possible interstitial process which would be 
consistent with a viral PNA. The patient has responded well to 
albuterol/ipratropium nebs. Antibiotics for HCAP were 
discontinued ___ with no change in patient's respiratory status. 
She completed a 5 day course of azithromycin. Steroids were 
tapered over a 9 day course (3 days remaining at time of 
discharge).

# HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: As above, she was intubated 
on the floor on ___ with profound ventilatory 
decompensation with a pH of 7.14 and pC02 104 after developing 
somnolence and encephalopathy earlier that morning.  CXR showed 
initially some increased interstitial marking, prompting concern 
for aspiration event (thick secretions were suctioned at the 
time of intubation), so vancomycin and zosyn were continued, in 
addition to azithromycin for atypical coverage.  She was given 
steroids as well due to wheezing  on exam. The cause of her 
decompensation remains somewhat unclear- the elevated 
bicarbonate and elevated venous pC02 on admission suggest a 
chronic hypoventilatory/hypoxemic disorder, and due to a lack of 
primary and secondary cigarette smoke exposure we suspect 
OSA/obesity hypoventilation syndrome particularly given her 
habitus.  We suspect that she began to retain C02 on the floor 
in her sleep due to hypoventilation which fed an encephalopathy 
possibly worsened by an aspiration event versus some pulmonary 
edema, which in turn suppressed her respiratory drive further. 
Her gas normalized quickly on CMV, though early trials of 
pressure support failed due to a complete lack of a respiratory 
drive.   As her encephalopathy waned, her respiratory drive 
improved. Due to a finding of some interstitial infiltrates on 
CXR, she was diuresed.  She was extubated successfully on ___ 
with in-tact mental status.  We stopped vancomycin and zosyn on 
___ due to lack of fevers or imaging evidence of pneumonia.  
Azithromycin was continued for a 5d course, and her steroids 
were tapered over 9 days (3 days left at discharge).  

# ___- Creatinine increased from a baseline of 0.9 to a peak of 
2.3. Urine lytes were consistent with pre-renal etiology.  She 
was given gentle hydration, diuretics, lisinopril and gabapentin 
were held. Cr had improved to baseline of 1.0 at time of 
discharge. 

# Altered Mental Status- The patient was noted by family to be 
confused on HD 3.  Infectious work-up including CXR, UA and 
blood cultures were unremarkable. She remained afebrile with a 
normal WBC, O2 saturation was initially stable. Electrolytes 
were normal with the exception of an elevated BUN and 
Creatinine. Symptoms were initially attributed to uremia in 
addition to a component of hospital induced delirium. However an 
ABG was done when her pulmonary status decompensated and as abve 
was notable for elevated CO2 suggesting CO2 narcosis. She was 
successfully extubated in the ICU and noted to still be altered. 
Over the course of the next 2 days after transfer to the floor 
her mental status markedly improved. At discharge she was AxOx3 
and interacting entirely appropriately and back to her 
baseline/normal mental status. 

# Hypotension- The patient was noted to be transiently 
hypotensive to the ___ on HD3.  She was afebrile.  BP improved 
with administration of fluids and remained stable. Her 
anti-hypertensives were held. As above infectious work-up was 
unremarkable. Her antihypertensives were restarted prior to 
discharge without event. 
 
# ?OSA: Patient sleepy during the day and per daughter has 
episodes of apnea. Supported by body habitus and likely chronic 
pCO2 in the ___. Patient maintained on O2 NC with goal sat 
90-95%. Will be set up with outpatient sleep medicine on 
discharge. 

Chronic issues: 
# Diabetes: On lantus and novolog at home as well as Actos. 
Actos was held and she was continued on lantus and HISS.

# Depression: Continued home mirtazipine

# HLD: Continued home simvastatin

Transitional issues: 
[ ]Needs follow-up with sleep medicine/pulmonary for likely 
undiagnosed OSA / obesity hyperventilation syndrome, may also 
need outpatient PFTs.
[ ] goal O2 sat 90-94, wean supplemental o2 as tolerates

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

You were admitted with a cough. We initially thought you had a 
bacterial pneumonia and treated you with antiobiotics. While you 
were in the hospital, your breathing declined and you were 
intubated and had to be in the intensive care unit. We gave you 
steroids and antibotics and you were extubated without 
complication and able to moved out of the ICU.  You completed a 
course of antibiotics and we are tapering you off of steroids. 
We believe that you may have had a viral pneumonia.  There is no 
treatment for these viruses but we gave you medication to help 
with the cough and the steroids will help decrease the 
inflammation and swelling in your lungs. You may continue to 
cough for several weeks before you return to your baseline.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old male with a history of DM, morbid 
obesity, dyslipidemia, HTN, and ? CAD who presents with 
complaints of shortness of breath to an OSH, now transfered to 
the ___ with concerns of cardiogenic shock.
.
The patient reports a history of angial pain with activity in 
the past, but has been asymptomatic for many years since being 
started on his current medication regimen. He reports two prior 
stress tests, the patient is unclear of the results. He reports 
being able to do his ADLs, but can only walk 2 blocks, limited 
by fatigue. However, on repeat questioning, reports episode 
within the last month of experiencing substernal chest pain, 
lasting many hours. Patient was hesitant to activate EMS, and 
pain eventually went away.
.
Starting six months ago, the patient developed significant 
orthopnea, has has to sleep sitting up in a chair. He has 
baseline lymphedma, an cannot comment regarding worsening ___ 
swelling. Since ___, the patient has felt marked 
dysnpnea, for which he saw his cardiologist. A TTE was 
performed, which by report, is notably worse than one from ___ 
years prior, with an EF of 20%. The patient was supposed to see 
his cardiologist in clinic the day of presentation, but felt too 
dysnpnic to clean his car of snow, so he activated EMS, and was 
brought to ___ for further care.
.
At the OSH ED, the patient's vitas were HR 100, BP 106/38, and 
99% on an unclear O2. The patient was noted to have a large left 
pleural effusion, for which he underwent a thoracentesis, with 
removal of 1 L liter serous fluid with protein count consistent 
with an exudative process by lytes criteria. The patient was 
believed to be in decompensated heart failure. He was given 60mg 
of IV lasix. Initial cardiac markers showed a troponin I of 
0.16, CK of 63. The patinet was given heparin, plavix, and IV 
metoprolol. After receiving the BB and lasix, the patient had 
worsening blood pressures in the ___, and was started on 
dobutamine per recommendations from cardiology, and transferred 
to ___ for further care.
.
On arrival, his HR was 115, BP of 80/50, and 94% on 6L NC. An 
EKG was obtained that showed concerning inferior ST elevation 
with reciprocal lateral changes. The patient was started on 
integrillin.  His dobutamine was weened off, and pressures 
improved.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black 
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. 
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other 
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Read ___.
 ___
___
.
ECHO ___ - The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe global 
left ventricular hypokinesis, with near-akinesis of the inferior 
wall (LVEF = ___, most consistent with multivessel coronary 
artery disease. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated 
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve 
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Significant aortic 
stenosis is present, but its precise quantification is limited 
by low stroke volume. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypertrophied left ventricle with severe 
global systolic dysfunction, most c/w multivessel CAD. 
Significant aortic stenosis. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
CXR ___ - FINDINGS: No previous images. There is enlargement 
of the cardiac silhouette
with pulmonary vascular congestion. Opacification at the left 
base most
likely represents pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis. 
The
possibility of supervening pneumonia can certainly not be 
excluded. A lateral
view would be most helpful if the condition of the patient 
permits.
.
CXR ___:
Compared to the prior study, there is no significant interval 
change in the
moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary vasculature congestion, 
bilateral pleural
effusions, left greater than right and dense retrocardiac 
opacity.
 
IMPRESSION: Persistent pulmonary edema. An underlying infectious 
infiltrate
cannot be totally excluded.
.
___ - b/l, no signs of DVT.  Preliminary.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, 
HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decombensated heart 
failure and possible ACS vs. PE.
.
# CORONARIES: While the patient only reported a history of 
anginal pain, EKG with evidence of prior anteroseptal infarct. 
This would remain consistent with new finding of reduced EF to 
20% on recent TTE. He had no complaints of chest pain during 
admission, although he is a diabetic.  EKG was concerning for a 
STEMI, with elevation only limited to a single lead.  On 
transfer, given concern for ACS, pt was started on ASA, Plavix, 
heparin gtt and integrillin gtt.  Metoprolol was held due to 
relative hypotension. Given tachycardia, HF, previous treatment 
with dobutamine, flat CKs and mild elevations of troponins, he 
was felt to have demand ischemia in inferior region w/ an 
overlying possible remote anterolateral infarct during the prior 
month (as CP reported in HPI and Qw in V1-3).  Integrillin gtt 
was discontinued on ___, heparin and remainder of above 
regimen was continued.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg TID was started on 
___ for tachycardia and to increase time in diastole and 
reduce demand.  Pt was diuresed for HF (see below).  No further 
intervention taken and pt was continued on aspirin, statin and 
metoprolol.
.
# PUMP: Pt. presented w/ dyspnea at rest, JVD, and CXR 
consistent w/ CHF.  Precipitous events of decompensated HF were 
not clear, but a possible old anterolateral infarct ~ 1mo ago 
was a most likely possibility, along w/ a possible pulmonary 
infection given exudative effusion (see below).  TTE showed 
dilated and hypertrophied left ventricle with severe global 
systolic dysfunction, most c/w multivessel CAD, EF ___. 
Significant aortic stenosis. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.  
New TTE findings and q-waves on EKG were consistent w/ recent MI 
with worsening heart failure.  Patient was started on lasix gtt. 
 Given -1L on 15mg of lasix gtt, metolazone was started to aid 
diuresis.  Pt was diuresed 2 Liters per day while in hospital. 
Pt. dyspnea at rest resolved by ___.  He was continued on low 
dose metoprolol.  Subsequently the Lasix gtt and Metolazone were 
discontinued, and Torsemide 40mg daily with acetazolamide was 
begun. (pt had contraction alkalosis on labs).  He continue to 
diurese and alkalosis improved.  ACE inhibitor was held ___ low 
BP and could not tolerate the addition.
.
# RHYTHM/PE: Sinus tachycarida. Likely secondary to decopensated 
heart failure, hypoxia.  Pulmonary embolis could not be ruled 
out given impaired renal function and a nl CXR.  LENIs b/l were 
negative, but limited by body habitus.  Given high risk of this 
patient for PE, he was started on heparin gtt and transitioned 
to warfarin. Although ultimately it was not felt that the 
patient had a PE, he was continued on coumadin for prophylaxis 
given his body habitus and sedentary lifestyle.  
Tachycardia improved to 80-90s w/ low dose metoprolol.
.
# Pulmonary Effusion.  Based on OSH results, was consistent w/ 
exudative effusion w/ 5950 WBCs, 75% PMNs, 20K RBCs and LDH > 
200.  Cytology from OSH was negative for malignant cells, smear 
showed PMNs w/o organisms and Cx were negative. Patient 
developed low grade fevers to 100.2F.  These findings were felt 
to be most consistent w/ a parapneumonic effusion, and patient 
was started on a 5 day course of Levofloxacin which he 
completed.  PPD was placed to r/o TB given exudative nature of 
effusion and was negative.  All surveillence blood cultures were 
negative. 
.
# Diabetes.  Home glyburide was held and patient was started on 
lantus and sliding scale while.  Hbg a1c was 5.8 suggesting good 
control of DM.  He continued to require Lantus and did well on 
16U/day however will need this titrated down as pt recovers.
.
# Hypothyroidism.  TSH was 0.29.  Pt was continued on home dose 
of synthroid. 
.
# Anemia - Pt noted have have Hct 31 although baseline was 
unknown.  Iron studies drawn were consistent with anemia of 
chronic disease.  Folate was within normal limits and his B12 
level was borderline low.  No evidence of hemolysis on labs.  He 
did have a guiac positive stool.  He was supplemented with iron,

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ from outside hospital with 
significant heart failure, concern for a heart attack and 
concern for fluid in your lungs.  

You were evaluated further and it was felt that most of your 
symptoms were due to heart failure.  You were also found to have 
fluid your lungs that was concerning for pneumonia, thus you 
were treated with antibiotics.  A TB test was performed and was 
negative. There was also concern for malignancy.  This should be 
addressed with you outpatient provider.

For your heart failure, you were treated with intravenous lasix 
and metolazone.  You shortness of breath improved significantly. 
 Your blood pressures were low, so your antiblood pressure 
medications were changed.  Because of your poor heart function 
and high risk for a vein or lung clot, you were started on 
coumadin.  

In addition, you were started on insulin because your sugar was 
high in the hospital. This will ideally be titrated off while in 
rehab.

You were also started on several other medications.  Please 
review the list below and please take the medications as 
prescribed below.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with a history of a Left Common Iliac Artery 
Aneurysm s/p Prior Coil Embolization who was admitted to the 
___ on ___. The patient 
was taken to the endovascular suite and underwent physician 
modified ___ and ___ renal artery stenting. For details of 
the procedure, please see the surgeon's operative note. The 
patient tolerated the procedure well without complications and 
was brought to the post-anesthesia care unit in stable 
condition. After a brief stay, the patient was transferred to 
the vascular surgery floor where he remained through the rest of 
the hospitalization. 

Post-operatively, he did well without any groin swelling. He 
did, however, have some post-operative issues with low oxygen 
saturations to the ___ with activity or while asleep. He has a 
substantial smoking history and has been diagnosed with COPD, 
though he reports he has refused outpatient inhalation 
medications or home oxygen on several occasions.  At discharge 
we feel his respiratory status is at baseline.

Prior to discharge, he was able to tolerate a regular diet, get 
out of bed and ambulate without assistance, void without issues, 
and pain was controlled on oral medications alone. He was deemed 
ready for discharge, and was given the appropriate discharge and 
follow-up instructions.  He is to remain on Plavix for the renal 
stent for the next month.   We have arranged followup with Dr. 
___ with CTA in one month as well.

STUDIES: 
TIB/FIB ___: Several fluoroscopic images from the operating 
demonstrate ORIF of a transverse right proximal tibial 
metaphyseal fracture.  There is good anatomic alignment and no 
hardware related complications. The total intraservice 
fluoroscopic time was 73.8 seconds. Please refer to the 
operative note for additional details.  There is also a fracture 
involving the fibular neck. Which is unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: ORIF ofa proximal right tibial metaphyseal fracture 
without complications.
.
CXR (___):  Severe cardiomegaly may have worsened since 
___ but there is no pulmonary edema and there is mild 
pulmonary vascular congestion.  The most significant new finding 
is a triangular opacity at the right lung base which, given the 
clinical history is either infection or infarction.  There is an 
associated tiny right pleural effusion.  There is no 
pneumothorax.
.
CTA CHEST (___): 
1. Several segmental pulmonary emboli involving the left lower 
lobe, right
upper lobe, and right middle lobe arteries with evidence of 
right heart
strain. No pericardial effusion.
2. Severe centrilobular emphysema.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis 
most
pronounced in the right lung base.
4. 5 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule. In the case of nodule 
size >4 - 6mm: For low risk patients, follow-up at 12 months and 
if no change, no further imaging needed. For high risk patients, 
initial follow-up CT at ___ months and then at ___ months if 
no change. However, further follow-up should be based on the 
goals of care and may be different from these recommendations.
5. Central adenopathy may be reactive.
.
TTE (___): The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left 
atrial volume index is severely increased. The right atrium is 
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at 
least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small. Left 
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF = 75%). Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is 
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated 
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. [Intrinsic right 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There are focal 
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe 
mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation 
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral 
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least 
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial 
effusion.
IMPRESSION: severe biatrial enlargement; small, underfilled, 
hyperdynamic left ventricle; severe tricuspid regurgitation  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o female with a past medical history of 
atrial fibrillation (not on anticoagulation due to h/o GIB), 
HTN, dCHF, osteopenia and GIB ___ duodenal ulcer who presented 
s/p mechanical fall with tib/fib fracture now s/p ORIF on ___ 
who is transferred to ___ for management of Afib with RVR, 
found to have b/l PE on CTA.

ACUTE ISSUES:
# Tibial fracture: Pt presented to the ED, found to have a 
proximal right tibia fracture and was admitted to the orthopedic 
surgery service.  The patient was taken to the operating room on 
___ for open reduction and internal fixation with right 
tibial ___ plate, which the patient tolerated well (for full 
details please see the separately dictated operative report). 
The patient was taken from the OR to the PACU in stable 
condition and after recovery from anesthesia was transferred to 
the floor.  The patient was initially given IV fluids and pain 
medications, and progressed to a regular diet. The patient was 
given perioperative antibiotics and anticoagulation per routine. 
With regards to her wound and skin, silvadene was applied 
liberally post-operatively and should be continued to be applied 
daily with new dry, sterile dressings. The patient is touch down 
weight bearing in the right lower extremity, and will be 
discharged on enoxaparin as bridge to coumadin as below. ___ 
determined that discharge to rehab was appropriate. Follow up 
with Ortho after discharge. 

# Afib with RVR: Pt has history of atrial fibrillation 
controlled with nodal agents at home. She had episodes of RVR 
following surgery that were initially attributed to stress 
response from surgery v. pain. She was asymptomatic and remained 
hemodynamically stable. Post-op day #3 she was still having 
episodes of RVR, although rate improved following IVF and was 
transferred to the Cardiology service (___). CTA chest revealed 
3 centrally-located PEs in b/l distribution. TTE with severe 
atrial enlargement, did not show evidence of right heart strain. 
TSH was WNL. Metoprolol succinate was uptitrated to 200mg daily 
for rate control prior to discharge with HRs in ______s-110. She 
will have a follow-up appointment with Cardiology after 
discharge. 

# PE: New O2 requirement post-op with CTA revealing bilateral 
PEs as well as atalectasis. Pt was on DVT PPX post-op however 
surgery and immobilization were still most likely provoking 
factors. She was started on Lovenox 70mg Q12hrs as bridge to 
coumadin. Factor Xa level was 0.76 (therapeutic) so dosing was 
kept the same. Incentive spirometry was encouraged given 
component of atalectasis. No evidence of pna on CTA chest. Prior 
to discharge she was breathing comfortably on room air. She 
should continue lovenox 70mg Q12hrs BID until INR is within goal 
range of ___ for 48hrs. Next INR check will be ___. Will need 
minimum of 3 months of systemic anticoagulation. 

# dCHF: EF 55-60% on TTE ___. Patient received IVF throughout 
hospitalization, however remained with low JVP and minimal ___ 
edema on exam. On transfer to Cardiology service received lasix 
10mg IV x2, then subsequently did not require diuretics. TTE 
while inpatient with hyperdynamic systolic function, increased 
PCWP, moderate 2+ MR and severe 4+ TR. Prior to discharge she 
was instructed on signs and symptoms of volume overload. She 
will have cardiology follow-up as an outpatient. 

# ___: patient has had creatinine elevation up to 1.2-1.4 from 
baseline 0.9. Creatinine improving to 1.0 after diuresis. Likely 
a component of cardiorenal syndrome in the setting of ___ 
versus transient hypotension in ___ period.

# Leukocytosis, neutrophilic predominant. Mostly likely due to 
stress response versus PE. WBC count downtrended to 10 prior to 
discharge. Remained afebrile without other localizing signs or 
symptoms to suggest infection. Urine culture negative. Blood 
cultures pending at the time of discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Osteopenia: started calcium and vitamin D.
# h/o breast cancer: continued aromatase inhibitor.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ because you broke 
your leg. While you were here you had a surgery to fix the 
fracture. After your surgery you went into an abnormal heart 
rhythm called atrial fibrillation with a fast heart rate. Your 
home medication metoprolol was increased to help slow down your 
heart rate. Because you were short of breath and requiring 
oxygen, we got a CAT scan of your chest that showed several 
blood clots in your lungs. You were started on two 
anticoagulants (Lovenox and coumadin) that you will need to 
continue taking after you leave to treat the blood clot until 
you are told by your doctor to stop. You will have follow-up 
appointments with your primary care doctor, Orthopedic Surgery 
and Cardiology. Please take your medications as prescribed and 
attend your follow-up appointments as scheduled. See below 
regarding additional instructions for care after your recent 
surgery. Please monitor your stools and notify your doctors if 
they are bloody or black. It was a pleasure participating in 
your care - we wish you all the best. 

Sincerely, 
Your ___ Team

WOUND CARE:
- You may shower. No baths or swimming for at least 4 weeks.
- Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be taken 
out at your follow up appointment.
- Your dressing should be changed every day, and Silvadene 
should be re-applied when the dressing is changed each day.

ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT BEARING:
- You may touch down weight bear with your right leg in your 
___ brace (unlocked)
Physical Therapy:
Right lower extremity:  Touchdown weight bearing
TDWB RLE in unlocked ___ (ROMAT)

Treatments Frequency:
# Please change dressing daily. Apply Silvadene to skin in thick 
layer daily when changing dressing. Please ensure dressing is 
adequately padded such that ___ brace is not putting 
pressure on the skin. Sutures/staples will be removed in the 
office at follow up.
# Next INR check ___, will need to take lovenox 70mg Q12hrs 
until INR therapeutic (goal INR 2.0-3.0, started coumadin ___

Brief Hospital Course:
  
.  
1. Shortness of breath: Description of symptoms more consistent 
with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as it woke him from sleep and 
he had to sit up to catch his breath. He has an elevated BNP and 
crackles on exam. He does not have any clear triggers for CHF 
exacerbation and has no oxygen requirement. He was dialyzed on 
the day of admission making volume overload less likely. CXR 
demonstrated a new infiltrate, and his asymmetric lung exam is 
consistent with a right lung process. He has had no fever and 
per his report, his cough is consistent with his chronic cough 
and the sputum is not new or different. He has slight leukopenia 
(day 11 post chemotherapy). He was started on levoquin/Vanco for 
his presumed pneumonia.  MI was ruled out with cardiac enzymes.  
He was also continued on his nebs and his cardiac medications as 
we felt heart failure could be contributing. 
.  
2. Diabetes: Continued his oral agents (glyburide) as the 
patient tolerating PO.
.  
3. ESRD: Dialysis consulted in the morning, decided to do an 
extra session of ultrafiltration to make the patient more 
comfortable. We discontinued his PhosLo as his phosphorus was 
low. 
.  
4. Leukopenia/Thrombocytopenia: s/p chemotherapy on ___. Plt 
count at baseline, wbc slightly lower most likely due to 
infection. We trended his CBC which remained stable and he did 
not require any transfusions.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-

Reason: Eval for PE/also history of hilar mass--?post 
obstructive pn
Field of view: 36

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with copd, lung cancer, bronchiectasis 
admitted with dyspnea, lower extremity edema 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval for PE/also history of hilar mass--?post obstructive 
pneumonia 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CLINICAL INDICATION: Dyspnea.

TECHNIQUE: 0.625-mm helically acquired images are obtained from 
the lung apices to the upper abdomen with intravenous contrast 
as a CT pulmonary angiogram protocol.

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of main, central, or segmental 
pulmonary embolism.

As on prior examination, there is enhancing soft tissue in the 
right hilus posterior to the right upper lobe bronchus with 
narrowing of the abutting airways. Overall, this is not 
significantly changed in appearance since the prior examination. 
Radiation changes are also noted within the right lung. Severe 
emphysema is noted. Within the right lower lobe, enlarging mass 
lesion identified measuring 23 x 14 mm, concerning for enlarging 
metastatic disease given the patient's clinical history. 
Increase in bibasilar airspace opacities, left greater than 
right. This may be related to aspiration. Clinical correlation 
is recommended. Small, calcified granuloma identified within the 
right upper lobe. Also, a 3-mm nodule is seen within the left 
upper lobe on image #44, series 4, not previously well seen.

A large hiatal hernia is noted. The visualized portions of the 
upper abdomen are grossly unremarkable.

Moderate-sized pericardial effusion is noted. This is not 
significantly changed in size since the prior study.

No suspicious lytic or blastic bony lesions are seen. There is 
evidence of prior kyphoplasty or possibly vertebroplasty 
involving the thoracic spine. This appears to have been 
performed in the interim between these studies. There is a 
suggestion of a small amount of cement within the spinal canal 
on the left, well seen on image #34, series 4.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

2. Stable enhancing soft tissue in the region of the right 
hilus. Also, increase in size of right lower lobe lung mass. 
This is worrisome for enlarging metastatic disease given the 
patient's clinical history.

3. Bilateral airspace disease seen at the lung bases, left 
greater than right. This may be related to atelectasis. Other 
considerations would be an infectious etiology.

4. Status post kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty procedure.

5. Large hiatal hernia.

6. Severe emphysema.

7. New small nodules seen within the left upper lobe as noted 
above.
=================================================
Very poor image quality.
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. No aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation is suggested by ___. The 
mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. No definite mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be estimated. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular 
cavity size and global systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
findings are similar. [No significant pericardial effusion was 
seen on review of the prior study).  
=======================================
Bilateral ___: no DVT
=======================================

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: This is a ___ year-old woman with severe 
COPD, NSCLCA s/p XRT/chemotherapy with no evidence of 
recurrence, radiation pneumonitis, bronchiectasis, diastolic 
heart failure, home oxygen requirement who presents with 
worsening shortness of breath and increasing lower extremity 
edema.

2)Copd 
3)Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure 
4)Bronchiectasis
5)Lower extremity edema
6)Radiation pneumonitis
7)Tracheobronchitis
8)Non small lung cancer

Patient's primary complaints of increased dyspnea and lower 
extremity edema attributed to possible diastolic heart failure 
and concern for recurrence of malignancy vs. new fungal 
pneumonia.   Maintained on baseline oxygen, outpatient pulmonary 
regimen throughout.  Diuresed with IV lasix about 2 liters with 
improvement in lower extremity edema, then lasix 20mg daily 
added to standing outpatient regimen. Echo stable from 
previous-unable to determine pulmonary pressures due to poor 
study, preserved EF.  CT scan of chest demostrated no PE, 
concern for enlarged pulmonary mass vs. possible evolving fungal 
pneumonia.  Bilateral ___ negative for  DVT. Beta glucan and 
galactomannin sent.  Followed by Dr. ___ Dr. ___ 
___.  Patient will follow up with both along with Dr. 
___ ongoing management/decision regarding onc and 
potentially ID issues.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ year old male with past medical history of 
Alzheimer's dementia, CAD s/p CABG, systolic CHF, COPD, diabetes 
mellitus type 2, CKF stage IV, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, 
hypertension, transferred from ___ ___ with 
episode of chest pain and abdominal pain, found to have had an 
NSTEMI, likely secondary to choledocholithiasis with biliary 
colic that resolved, cleared by general surgery, seen by 
cardiology, status post nuclear stress test with normal 
myocardial perfusion, discharged home with PCP and cardiology 
___

# Nausea / Choledocholithiasis without Obstruction - patient 
presented with nonspecific symptoms to ___.  Imaging 
there was notable for cholelithiasis with gallbladder wall 
thickening.  Patient was transferred to ___ where ultrasound 
showed non-specific gallbladder thickening with HIDA scan 
negative for signs of cholecystitis.  Initial transaminitis 
trended down.  Patient was presumed to have had an episode of 
missed biliary colic.  He was seen by general surgery who agreed 
that no acute surgical needs were present--they recommended 
outpatient discussion regarding risk/benefit of cholecystectomy. 
 Would consider rechecking LFTs to ensure complete 
normalization.  Prior to discharge, ALT 48, AST 31, Alk Phos 94, 
Tbili 1.1.  

# NSTEMI - In setting of nonspecific nausea and reports of chest 
pain, patient was found to have elevated troponin, peaking at 
0.26 on day 2 of admission.  EKG unchanged from baseline.  
Patient was seen by cardiology and was continued on home 
optimized regimen with metoprolol, ASA, statin.  Troponins 
trended down and chest pain did not recur.  NSTEMI was felt to 
be secondary to above RUQ process.  Nuclear stress test 
demonstrated normal myocardial perfusion. Cardiology recommended 
that no additional interventions were indicated.  Discharged 
with close PCP ___ on cardiac regimen. Would check blood 
pressure at ___ visit to ensure no additional optimization 
is indicated. 

# Acute systolic CHF - Patient initially reported dyspnea on 
presentation.  While Xray raised question of new opacity, 
prompting antibiotics, chest CT performed at ___ did 
not show any consolidations.  Antibiotics were stopped.  Patient 
appeared volume overloaded on exam, and was given IV lasix with 
subsequent resolution of symptoms.  Has known ACE-I allergy.  
Continued home cardiac medications as above as well as home 
lasix. Discharge weight = 46.8kg

# Atrial Fibrillation / Coagulopathy - Patient presented with 
INR 7.4 without signs of bleeding.  This was felt to be 
secondary to coumadin in setting of recent poor PO intake. 
Coumadin was held without administration of FFP or vitamin K.  
INR improved and coumadin was restarted at 2.5mg daily (from 
prior 4mg daily).  Discharged with home services including INR 
check.  Continued home metoprolol and diltiazem. 

# Dementia - Continued galantamine 

# BPH - continued home tamsulosin 

# COPD - continued home fluticasone 

# GERD - continued home Ranitidine 

# DM type 2 - Patient was had low-normal fingersticks throughout 
admission.  Home repaglinide was held at discharge.  Would 
recheck fingerstick at ___ visit to guide whether or not 
to restart. 

Transitional Issues
- Would recheck blood pressure at ___ visit and consider 
addition of new agent if needs additional control (for cardiac 
optimization after recent NSTEMI)
- Held repaglinide at discharge given low-normal fingersticks 
without it during admission; can assess for restart at ___
- Can assess for transition from metoprolol tartrate to 
succinate at ___ 
- Discharge weight = 46.8kg
- Coumadin dose decreased this admission due to presentation 
with supratherapeutic INR; INR at discharge 1.9; would recheck 
at ___ 
- Would consider/discuss referral to surgeon regarding 
risk/benefit of cholecystectomy

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___: 

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  You were admitted 
with nausea and chest pain.  You were found to have had a heart 
attack (""non-ST elevation MI"").  This was felt to have been 
caused by stress on your body caused by a momentary blockage of 
your biliary ducts that resolved on its own.  You were seen by 
surgeons, who recommended against surgery right now.  You were 
seen by a cardiologist and underwent testing of your heart that 
did not show any concerning blockages.  You improved and are now 
ready for discharge home. 

Since your INR (Coumadin level) was high on admission, we have 
decreased your dose of Coumadin to 2.5mg daily.  It will be 
important for you to have your INR checked at your next visit.  

It will be important for you to follow up with your primary care 
doctor to have your blood pressure checked, and to discuss 
whether or not you should see a surgeon about having your 
gallbladder removed in the future.  It will be important for you 
to see your cardiologist.

MICROBIOLOGY
=============

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ y/o man with a PMH of dementia, CAD 
(prior NSTEMI, type II), HTN, IDDM, hypothyroidism, BPH, recent 
admission to ___ for complicated UTI in ___ and admission 
to ___ in ___ for TURP and cystoscopy, who presents 
as a transfer from ___ with septic shock, respiratory 
failure, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia. 

# SEPTIC SHOCK
# COMPLICATED UTI. History of pan-sensitive Proteus and 
Enterobacter infections. History of Pseudomonas at ___. 
Given risk of Pseudomonas with history of insulin-dependent 
diabetes as well as current ___ plan to broadly cover 
with cefepime/vancomycin for now and follow blood/urine 
cultures. No evidence of pneumonia on CXR. Leukopenia consistent 
with severe sepsis. s/p 5L IV fluid resuscitation. Abdominal 
pain on presentation may have suggested an alternative 
intra-abdominal etiology such as enteritis or diverticulitis, 
although there is no history of bloody diarrhea to suggest this. 
If he fails to improve with antibiotics, would consider further 
imaging of abdomen/pelvis and adding on anaerobic coverage. The 
patient was continued on three pressor shock and his lactatic 
acid and acidosis was worse leading to worsening of blood 
pressures. Talking to the family regarding code status directed 
us to a DNR/DNI state. Also the family did not want to escalate 
care. There no additional pressors were added. The patient's 
blood pressure continuously dropped and suffered from a cardiac 
arrest and passed away on 4:10 AM. 

# RESPIRATORY FAILURE
# TOXIC, METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
# DEMENTIA
Respiratory failure secondary to obtundation and inability to 
protect airway. CXR without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary 
edema. His encephalopathy may be secondary to sepsis on poor 
baseline mental substrate, however the most worrisome possible 
etiology would be intracranial hemorrhage given his history of 
falls. For now, will attempt to minimize sedation and obtain 
reliable exam and, if unable to do so, proceed with NCHCT. The 
patient was kept on minimal sedation. 

# POLYMORPHIC VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA
# VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION.
# ELEVATED TROPONIN. 
# CAD
s/p amiodarone 300 mg IV bolus, now on amiodarone IV load. 
Received external shocks x8 at ___ for polymorphic 
VT/VF. Suspect etiology may have been epinephrine boluses in the 
setting of septic shock, particularly given minimally elevated 
troponin (does have history of CAD and demand NSTEMI). Will 
evaluate for structural heart disease, monitor for signs of 
ischemia. No further tachyarrthymias here. Suspect elevated 
troponin secondary to cardiac trauma from defibrillation. The 
patient was given amio bolus and kept on a drip.

# ANION GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS. Unclear etiology; lactate 2.5, 
no ketones in urine; unlikely to represent co-ingestion. 
Differential also includes renal tubular acidosis, though 
relatively less likely. Will continue to monitor, fluid 
resuscitate, and correct academia. Acidosis deteriorate as his 
lactate worsened. His acidosis was not corrected with NaHCO3. 
The patient passed away due to worsening. 

CHRONIC ISSUES

History of Present Illness:
EU Critical ___ (aka ___ is an ___ year-old 
right-handed woman with HTN, HLD, chronic back pain, ?paranoid 
schizophrenia on seroquel who presents after an episode of 
unresponsiveness this evening, transferred from OSH after CT 
head showed possible SAH.

She was in her usual state of health this morning.  At baseline 
she lives with her husband and daughter, she is independent in 
ADLS, normally fully oriented, conversational in ___ and 
___, ambulatory without assistance.  Her family took her to a 
restaurant around 5PM today and while she was eating dinner, 
initially seemed withdrawn and uninterested in the food when it 
arrived to the table.  Around 5:30PM she slumped over to the 
left and became less verbal, closed her eyes and no longer 
followed commands.  The grandson thinks she may have had ___ 
seconds of brief bilateral arm flexion but no prolonged 
convulsions, tongue-biting, urinary incontinence.  Although she 
was not following commands or speaking, she was moving the arms 
and legs antigravity spontaneously with no apparent focal 
weakness.  

EMS was alerted taken to ___ where she was 
minimally verbal, reverted to speaking mostly in ___, but 
without apparent focality.  VS on arrival T- 98.1 BP-128/55 
HR-51, RR-16 Spo2-98%. There was initial concern that she was 
not able to protect her airway but on prepping her for possible 
intubation, she open eyes and became more responsive.  Urgent CT 
head showed possible trace convexal SAH in the parietal sulcus 
versus artifact and the patient was transferred to ___ for 
urgent MRI.

On arrival to BI VS BP- awake moving all extremities 
antigravity. Due to unclear history of bleed versus stroke, a 
Code Stroke was alerted.  No family was available to verify the 
history and initial report was that she was ___ 
only, and as she was minimally verbal, and not following 
commands, her exam was poor.  She went for urgent CT/CTA/CTP and 
those studies redemonstrated the subtle right parietal SAH.  She 
has a diminutive left vertebral artery but otherwise on review 
with Radiology no obvious occlusion, stenosis or evidence of 
top-of-the-basilar syndrome.  LP was recommended in the ED to 
confirm SAH.  When family did finally arrive to the ED around 
1:30PM she was following simple commands for then to open eyes, 
squeeze hand, wiggle toes.  She said ""I love ___ to her 
grandson in ___. Despite improvement, still nowhere near her 
baseline per family.

Of note she had a recent admit to ___ in ___ for 
intermittent chest pain. At that time endorsed a period of ___ 
weeks prior to admission with poor medication compliance.  
Cardiology was consulted, trops were negative, normal EKG, 
ultimately felt non-cardiac.

A detailed ROS is not possible due to mental status.  Family 
notes that she had not been feeling unwell recently, no 
fevers/chills, HA, nausea/vomiting or neck stiffness.  Her only 
complain in the past few days was of back pain, which is chronic 
for her.
 
Past Medical History:

-CHF/edema, previously on furosemide
-Paranoid schizophrenia. had been on standing haldol for ___ 
years, 2 weeks ago switched to seroquel by her psychiatrist due

IMAGING:
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ presented to an outside hospital after 
becoming unresponsive at a restaurant with persistent 
unresponsiveness. There a CT head was concerning for R parietal 
subarachnoid blood and he was transferred to ___. She 
subsequently returned to her baseline, which was alert and quite 
paranoid which interfered with full neurologic examination. A 
broad differential was considered, including seizure, syncope, 
stroke/TIA and psychogenic. Her workup was notable for: LP with 
bland CSF and negative cultures; CTA with atherosclerosis in the 
bilateral vertebral origins and carotid arteries without 
stenosis and LDL was 100; MRI which demonstrated small vessel 
disease but no acute stroke, acute or chronic hemorrhage, or 
evidence of metastasis; EEG which showed no seizures nor 
epileptiform discharges. On telemetry her QTc remained in the 
440-450s while on quetiapine and there was no evidence of 
arrhythmia. Her troponins were negative on admission. Her 
symptoms were thought to be most likely seizure vs. syncope and 
no treatment was started. Her home medications were continued 
and she was discharged home in stable condition.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ came to the hospital because of an episode of 
unresponsiveness. We think that ___ may have lost consciousness. 
We have looked for dangerous causes of this episode and have not 
found anything which needs intervention right now. We are not 
certain of the cause of this episode. 
 - It could have been caused by the heart and a temporary 
decrease in the blood going to the brain. We looked for any 
arrhythmias or any evidence of heart attack and did not see any.
 - It could have been caused by seizure, or abnormal electrical 
activity in the brain. We got an EEG which did not show any 
seizures. This does not rule out the possibility that she could 
have had one, but makes it less likely. 
 - It is very unlikely that this was due to a stroke or a 
transient ischemic attack. We did an MRI which showed no acute 
stroke. There was some evidence of chronic changes in the brain 
caused by high blood pressure and cholesterol.
 - Originally there was some concern for blood in the brain, 
also known as subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the MRI (a more 
sensitive test) did not show any evidence of hemorrhage.

We have not made any changes to your medications. ___ should 
continue to take them as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology, your primary care, and your 
psychiatrist as outlined below.

It has been a pleasure taking care of ___.

Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
___ hx Stage IV ovarian Ca dx in ___ with initiation 
of chemotherapy ___, ESRD s/p live donor transplant 
(failing) on HD MWF, CAD s/p MI w/DES, valvular heart dz, HTN, 
HLD, p/w dyspnea. 

To the ED, she reported 2d progressively worsening dyspnea. She 
underwent HD on ___ as scheduled w/o improvement in dyspnea. 

In the ED, initial VS were: 99.7 125 122/72 25 93% RA.
 
ED physical exam was recorded as: cachetic unwell appearing lady 
with hx of ESRD on HD and ovarian ca, currently undergoing chemo 
presents with c/o shortness of breath. feels as if cant get 
enough air in, +crackles 

ED labs were notable for: WBC 12.6 (down to 9.8 on rpt). H/H 
7.8/25.4 (stable on rpt). proBNP 52,368. Na 132/Cl 93, similar 
on rpt, but with BUN/Cr up to ___. Trop 0.28, down to 0.22 on 
rpt with CK-MB flat.  Lactate 1.9, flu negative. UA with Mod 
Leuk, WBC 29. INR 1.6. 

CXR showed:
IMPRESSION:    
Large right and small to moderate left pleural effusions with 
overlying atelectasis.  Bilateral mid lung opacities could be 
due to atelectasis and pulmonary edema/ vascular congestion, 
although underlying infection is not excluded in the appropriate 
clinical setting. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema. 

___ showed:
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins. 
Calcified atherosclerosis noted in the arteries, but not well 
assessed on this study. 

Lung Scan showed: IMPRESSION: Low likelihood of pulmonary 
embolism. 
  
EKG showed: ECG with TWI in aVL and V1-V3 

Patient was seen by Cardiology (excerpt):
""...SOB likely in setting of volume overload given large 
effusions. NSTEMI likely type II in setting of ESRD and fluid 
overload. There are ECG changes (though no recent uploaded 
priors, last ECGs were i/s/o hyperkalemia) but she does not have 
her typical anginal symptoms which is reassuring.
 Recommendations:
 - serial troponin, CK-MB, and ECGs
 - reasonable to continue heparin gtt while awaiting CK-MB
 - continue home aspirin
 - agree with diuresis if able
 - admit to oncology vs. medicine for treatment of recurrent 
ascites and pleural effusion in setting of ovarian ca 
(previously exudative)
 - can consider TTE if CK-MB elevated or dynamic ECG changes""

Patient was seen by Renal (excerpt):
""- Has no acute HD needs for electrolytes or volume but can 
trial some additional UF/challenge dry weight tomorrow with HD
 - Suspect SOB is driven by pleural effusions, likely 
malignancy, which will not be removed by HD and she is at her 
dry weight. Has some pitting edema in legs (albumin is 2.6)
 - Would consider thoracentesis and parecentesis to relieve 
dyspnea but agree with Lung scan to rule out PE given acute 
onset and increased risk of thrombus in setting of cancer
 - Agree with trending Trops and serial EKGs""
Also added that tacrolimus should be continued.

Transfer VS were: 98.5 112 129/79 19 98% Nasal Cannula. 

When seen on the floor, patient is feeling better though still 
short of breath. She essentially endorses the story above, that 
she was in her usual state of health, no sick contacts, no 
shortened HD sessions, when she started to feel weak and have 
shortness of breath on ___ night. This became progressively 
worse, and HD on ___ did not make her feel better. She did 
call the ___ clinic who referred her in for evaluation. She 
endorses generalized weakness. She has chronic constipation and 
decreased appetite d/t early satiety, the latter subacute and 
unrelated to SOB. She denies lightheadedness, dizziness, fevers, 
chills, cough, congestion, chest pain, abdominal pain, does 
endorse abdominal distension (better since recent paracentesis, 
though she feels her abdomen is slowly getting larger again), 
urinary frequency or pain with urination (still makes small

then 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every 8 hours as needed x 2 days, 
then 1 tablet every 12 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every before bedtime as needed x 1 day.  
Then continue with Tylenol for pain.
  3)  Do not stop the Tylenol until you are off of the narcotic 
medication.
  4)  Per state regulations, we are limited in the amount of 
narcotics we can prescribe. If you require more, you must 
contact the office to set up an appointment because we cannot 
refill this type of pain medication over the phone. 
  5)  Narcotic pain relievers can cause constipation, so you 
should drink eight 8oz glasses of water daily and continue 
following the bowel regimen as stated on your medication 
prescription list. These meds (senna, colace, miralax) are over 
the counter and may be obtained at any pharmacy.
  6)  Do not drink alcohol, drive a motor vehicle, or operate 
machinery while taking narcotic pain relievers.
  7)  Please take all medications as prescribed by your 
physicians at discharge.
  8)  Continue all home medications unless specifically 
instructed to stop by your surgeon.

ACTIVE ISSUES 
=============
#Dizziness. Episode consistent with hypovolemia given history 
(poor oral intake, being outside in the heat, relative 
hypotension). He received 500 cc NS and lytes repletion upon 
admission. Patient also seen by neurology and he received a CTA 
brain which was unremarkable for a stroke. His magnesium was 
also low at 0.8, which can contribute to his symptoms of 
weakness and dizziness. The most likely etiology is likely 
hypovolemia given quick resolution of his symptoms. Following 
admission patient remained asymptomatic.

#CKD. Cr 1.3 at baseline. We initially thought his admission ___ 
of 1.3 represented an ___. However, per PCP ___ office, 
patient had Cr 1.4 in ___, 1.3 in ___. We believe his Cr to 
now be at baseline given these lab findings. Told 
patient to stop lasix until he sees his PCP again and has a lab 
check. 

#HFpEF. Elevated BNP on admission however without clear symptoms 
of hypervolemia. Creatinine bumped with diuresis. Lungs clear 
with stable peripheral edema, not felt to have acute HFpEF 
exacerbation. Due to soft blood pressure and stable volume 
status, lasix and valsartan was held prior to discharge. Can 
consider restarting based on blood pressure and volume status on 
PCP ___. 

#Hypomagnesemia. Mg 0.8 on admission, given magnesium repletion 
and monitored.

#Troponinemia. Low suspicion for ACS. Troponin 0.06 upon 
admission. EKG without ischemic changes and denied angina 
symptoms. Repeat Troponin remained stable with CK MB 3. 

#Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. CHADSVASC 7. Continued on home 
dose metoprolol and warfarin. Remained therapeutically 
anticoagulated during hospital course.

#Hypertension: Held his home losartan given history of dizziness 
and normotension.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES 
=====================
#Prior CVA: cont home atorvastatin
#GERD: cont home omeprazole
#DM: held home metformin, ISS while inpatient. Resume metformin 
as outpatient.
#Mediastinal LAD. Seen on CTA upon admission, follow up after 
discharge. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- HELD losartan and Lasix this admission
[ ] At first PCP ___, please check Chem 7 to monitor 
Creatinine. Also please check magnesium given very low Mg levels 
upon admission
[ ] At first PCP ___, consider restarting Lasix based on 
volume exam
[ ] At first PCP ___, consider restarting valsartan based 
on blood pressure
[ ] On patient's CTA brain, the radiologist commented on some 
prominent mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Consider follow up with 
repeat imaging or biopsy.

CXR ___

FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest 
demonstrate top normal 
heart size.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours 
are normal.  
Calcification of the aortic knob is unchanged.  There is 
persistent patchy 
opacities in the right lower lobe and periphery of the left 
lung.  There is 
new prominence of the interstitial markings consistent with mild 
pulmonary 
edema.  There are new small bilateral pleural effusions greater 
on the right 
than the left.  No pneumothorax.  No displaced rib fracture 
identified. 
  
IMPRESSION: Persistent opacities in the right lower lobe and 
left upper lobe 
with mild pulmonary edema and new bilateral small pleural 
effusions.   

___ ___

IMPRESSION: 
  
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left leg.  
Superficial edema is noted in the left calf. 

Renal U/S ___

FINDINGS: 
  
The right kidney measures 11.1 cm and the left kidney measures 
10.8 cm.  There 
is a 8 mm simple cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney.  
There is no 
hydronephrosis, stones or masses.  Renal echogenicity and 
corticomedullary 
architecture are within normal limits.  The bladder is only 
minimally 
distended and cannot be assessed.   
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
Unremarkable renal ultrasound. 

___ CXR

FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been 
substantial 
decrease in the pulmonary vascular congestion with the cardiac 
size remaining 
at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged.  Small 
bilateral pleural 
effusions are seen with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  
Discrete areas 
of consolidation are not definitely appreciated on this study. 
  
Hyperexpansion of the lungs with flattening of the 
hemidiaphragms is 
consistent with chronic pulmonary disease.  There is extensive 
calcification 
in the aortic arch and descending portion. 

___ CXR

FINDINGS: 
  
As compared to the prior examination, there has been mild 
worsening of the 
patient's moderate to severe interstitial pulmonary edema.  
Small bilateral 
pleural effusions are stable.  There is no focal consolidation 
or 
pneumothorax.  Stable, mild cardiomegaly is noted.  Aortic 
calcifications are 
seen.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly normal. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
Interval worsening of moderate to severe interstitial pulmonary 
edema, with 
associated small, bilateral pleural effusions.   

___ CT Chest non-contrast

IMPRESSION: 
1.  Multifocal pneumonia, suggesting aspiration. with increased 
right pleural 
effusion, now moderate and new small left pleural effusion. 
2.  Moderate pulmonary edema has minimally improved since 
___, but 
moderate right pleural effusion is larger and small left 
effusion is new, 
pointing to heart failure. 
3.  Mediastinal nodes borderline enlarged, the largest in the 
subcarinal 
station and might be reactive. 
4.  Moderate-to-severe coronary calcification, and calcification 
of the aortic 
annulus, aortic valve and mitral annulus, all unchanged since 
___ 

___ CXR

FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the degree of 
pulmonary 
vascular congestion has substantially improved, though there is 
still evidence 
of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.  Atelectatic changes are 
seen at the 
bases, especially on the left.  An area of apparent scarring is 
again seen in 
the left mid zone laterally, is essentially unchanged from the 
CT scan of 
___. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o COPD, asthma, hypertension, and few months worsening 
pruritic xerosis presenting with dyspnea found to have volume 
overload, hyperkalemia and renal failure

# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient presented with acute 
renal failure with creatinine of 2.2 (baseline ~1.0), likely 
contrast induced from a CT PE on the previous hospital 
admission. Her renal failure manifested with hyperkalemia, 
volume overload and subsequent respiratory distress. Due to 
volume overload, she was diuresed with IV medicines requiring 
metolazone as well as high dose IV furosemide. In the setting of 
diuresis, her creatinine uptrended due to pre-renal 
hypoperfusion up to 3.5. As such, diuresis was discontinued. The 
patient continued to make good urine on her own and maintain a 
constant weight. Upon discharge, her creatinine was downtrending 
and did not require medications for volume overload. Moving 
forward, she will likely require initiation of oral diuretics 
for what will likely become chronic renal failure. Furthermore, 
she will be followed by Nephrology with the possibility for 
dialysis planning as she required such high doses of IV diuresis 
in ___ to off load volume and potassium due to kidney 
dysfunction.

# Acute diastolic CHF: Patient presented with pulmonary edema 
requiring 3L of oxygen due to kidney failure as discussed above. 
An echo showed a preserved ejection fraction. She was diuresed 
with improvement of her dyspnea. Her discharge weight is 56 kg - 
there is no known dry weight for her. With this weight, she was 
able to maintain a saturation of 93% on room air. Diuresis was 
limited due to kidney injury. 

# COPD exacerbation: Patient presented with a clinical exam 
concerning for acute bronchoconstriction and hypoxemia. 
Pulmonary edema contributed to this picture. She completed a 
course of antibiotics as well as two prednisone bursts (5 days 
each) as her pulmonary exam remained poor throughout admission. 
She was treated with duel nebs and maintained on her home COPD 
medications. Pulmonary was consulted in ___ and recommended 
repeat CT scan and pulmonology follow up for both COPD and 
incidental findings on CT of unclear etiology and significance. 

# Multi-focal Bacterial pneumonia on CT: Patient clinically did 
not have signs of pneumonia but radiographic examination 
revealed multiple areas of consolidation. In discussion she with 
pulmonology she was treated with levofloxacin. However her 
course was cut short because of worsening kidney function in the 
setting of diuresis. The CT scan also suggested the possibility 
of Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection. Induced sputums 
could not be obtained in ___ due to logistical challenges. She 
will follow up with pulmonology for further workup. 

# Hyponatremia: Observed in the setting of diuresis so likely 
due to hypovolemia. If she continues to become hyponatremic can 
consider tightening her free water intake - 1500 cc from ___ cc 
in ___. Opted to not be aggressive in giving fluid in the 
setting of dCHF. 

# Presyncope: Patient felt light headed with blurry vision most 
likely related to over diuresis and uremic toxins. Her blood 
pressure was stable. No concern for seizure, new infection, 
neurological event, or arrhythmia. Her symptoms resolved with 
the cessation of diuresis. 

# Pleural effusion: Likely related to ___. Her history of 
weight loss and smoking history is concerning for malignancy, 
but there were no findings in the lung based upon CT. She will 
be followed by pulmonology and repeat CT scan for evaluation. 
Based upon CXR, these pleural effusion improved with diuresis.

# Hypertension: Blood pressure was high in ___. Her amlodipine 
was discontinued due to lower extremity swelling that confounded 
her clinical evaluation of volume status. Labetalol was 
initiated and uptitrated until appropriate blood pressure 
control.

# Hematuria: Traumatic Foley with aspirin and heparin 
prophylaxis. Spontaneously resolved.

# Hyperkalemia: patient presented with potassium observed in 
___ as high as 6.9. No ECG changes were observed. She was 
supported with calcium gluconate, insulin, Kayexalate and 
diuretics while her kidneys recovered. Prior to discharge, her 
potassium was normal. However in the setting of kidney disease 
and unclear prognosis, she will need lab checks for potassium 
and close follow up with nephrology.

# Chest pain: Likely related to anxiety and dyspnea. She was 
ruled out for ACS. 

# Leukocytosis: No localizing source of infection found in ___ 
and was likely related to steroid.

# Pruritis: Patient had several months of a pruritic xerotic 
rash on admission of unclear etiology. PET CT scan negative 
___ so likely no paraneoplastic cause. Rheumatology workup 
was negative; ___, anti-dsDNA, anti-Ro, and anti-La are 
negative. She was given hydroxyzine PRN with good effect.  

# Anemia: There was no evidence of active bleeding. MCV 108, 
suggestive of B12, folate deficiency vs marrow. Will defer 
workup to outpatient. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
========================
- Patient will need daily cardiopulmonary examination, 
measurement of input and output, weights, in order to monitor 
for volume overload due to CHF and kidney failure for the 
possibility of initiation diuretic therapy 
- Patient will also need chem 10 every 3 days to evaluate for 
electrolyte abnormalities in the setting of kidney failure until 
stable

Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___. You came because of shortness of 
breath. We found that you had built up fluid in your lungs 
because your kidneys were not working normally. Due to the 
kidney disease, your potassium was also high. We used medicines 
to remove the fluid and potassium from your body. We also used 
medicines to treat COPD and pneumonia. Your breathing is better 
and now ready to go to rehabilitation to work on your strength. 
Please continue to take the rest of your medications and follow 
up with your doctors.

the ED. Recently her BP had been controlled per her PCP's office 
with readings no higher than 144/80. 
.
In the ED, ___ was initially negative. Besides vertigo, 
she reported no other symptoms. She was well-appearing with no 
nystagmus or JVD. Her neuro exam was benign. BP was 159/98 
without any intervention. Repeat ___ in the ED 
reproduced her symptoms of vertigo slightly. EKG showed new 
first degree AVB, new RBBB, TWI in V3 compared to ___. Initial 
CE were negative. CXR showed low lung volumes but no acute 
process.
.
Currently she reports vertigo when moving her head in certain 
ways; for example, rolling over to her back from lying on her 
left side reproduced the symptoms. She does not have any other 
focal symptoms including CP, SOB, visual changes, headaches,

delay may be expected given her age. the patient did not have 
symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, N/V. Cardiac 
enzymes were trended X 2 and were negative.  She was monitored 
on telemetry and did not have any significant events.  The 
possibility of a stress test was discussed with patient.  She 
was not interested in cardiac cath if stress test shows 
reversible defect and prefered not to have a stress test.
.
4. Anxiety: patient was continued on her home regimen of remeron 
and lorazepam.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent CABG x 3 with Dr. ___.  Overall the 
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring.  He required multiple blood products in the 
immediate post-op period.  He had VTac in the OR and was placed 
on Amiodarone.  Permanent Pacemaker was interrogated.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and 
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient 
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient 
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  He 
continued to have runs of VTac and was placed on PO Amio.  
Coumadin was also resumed for chronic AFib.  Chest tubes and 
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The 
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge 
on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was 
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The 
patient was discharged to LiveCare of the ___ in good 
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

INTERPRETATION: ___ year old man (h/o hypereosinophilic syndrome; 
CAD 
and s/p CABG in ___ PCI to RCA in ___ and BMS to RCA in 
___ 
was referred to the lab for the evaluation of chest pain and 
shortness 
of breath. The patient was infused with 0.142 mg/kg/min of 
Persantine 
over 4 minutes. The patient denied any arm, neck, back, or chest 

discomfort throughout the procedure. Post-infusion, the patient 
did 
report nausea and mild lightheadedness which resolved following 
the 
administration of 125 mg aminophylline IV. In the presence of 
diffuse 
ST-T wave changes at baseline, no additional changes were noted. 

The rhythm was sinus with frequent isolated VPBs noted 
throughout the 
procedure with short runs of ventricular trigeminy. The 
hemodynamic 
response to the infusion was appropriate. 
  
IMPRESSION: Atypical persantine-induced symptoms in the absence 
of ECG 
changes from baseline. Ventricular ectopy as described. Nuclear 
report 
sent separately.

RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA: 
   11.0 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Rest ___ 
   29.1 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ___ 
HISTORY: ___ year old man with CAD s/p CABG (___), presents with 
dyspnea on  
exertion.  
  
SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:  
Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose 
of 0.142 
mg/kg/min.  
  
METHOD:  
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi.  
Tracer was 
injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting 
images.  
Following resting images and two minutes following intravenous 
dipyridamole, 
approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m sestamibi 
was administered 
intravenously.  Stress images were obtained approximately 45 
minutes following 
tracer injection.  
Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.  
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial 
perfusion model.  
  
INTERPRETATION:   
Left ventricular cavity size is at the upper limits of normal 
and stable.  
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal possible minimal 
reversible defect in 
the inferolateral wall, which has improved compared to the 
previous study of 
___.  
  
Gated images reveal unchanged wall motion with mild septal 
hypokinesis 
consistent with history of CABG.  
  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 61%, 
improved from 48% on 
___.  
  
IMPRESSION:  1.  Probably normal study with improvement in the 
mild reversible 
inferolateral wall defect seen on the prior study.  2.  Normal, 
improved LV 
systolic function (EF 61%), with unchanged wall motion 
consistent with prior 
CABG.  
  

___, M.D.
 

___, M.D.
 
Approved: WED ___ 4:52 ___ 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
SHORTNESS OF BREATH: the patient initially had a complaint of 
dyspnea on exertion which seemed to be crescendo and given his 
atypical symptoms which could have been anginal in nature and 
his high cardiac risk he was started on a heparin drip until he 
ruled out for MI.  Once he ruled out he was stressed with a 
p-MIBI which revealed an improvement in the mild reversible 
inferolateral defect he had prior to his last cath, no other 
abnormalities.  He also had an echo which was unchanged from ___ 
year ago.  He had an ultrasound of his L leg given assymetric 
edema which was negative.  His ambulatory O2 sat was 94% and he 
was never hypoxic throughout his stay.  His CXR was negative.  
Upon further discussion his shortness of breath seemed to 
improve.  It is unclear if increasing his lasix to 80mg po bid 
as the patient had done for 4 days prior to coming to the 
hospital is what aided in this relief or not.  He states that he 
has a fullness to his neck upon exertion so it was important to 
rule out cardiac ischemia for this but beyond that it is unclear 
what could be causing these symptoms, he does have tricuspid 
regur and perhaps this is giving him the sensation of venous 
congestion in his neck.

He also has a chronic cough and given his lymphoma it would be 
worth getting PFTs and a high resolution CT scan.  The patient 
will follow up with pulmonary at ___ along with PFTs as an 
outpatient.  This is scheduled for 1 week from discharge.  He 
was discharged on his home dose of lasix 80mg po daily.

CKD- stage IV, followed by ___, baseline Cr 2.8-3.1,

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with h/o HTN, Afib on coumadin, diastolic HF 
(EF 75%), DM admitted ___ with fevers/cough and dx c CAP. 
Intially placed on levaquin. However, hospital course 
complicated by worsening hypoxia requiring MICU transfer ___. 
At this time, Abx broadened to Vanc/zosyn/azithro. also CTA done 
which ruled out PE and redemonstrated extensive consolidation. 
Trops negative and Echo no WMA, EF 75%. Etiology of hypoxia 
still CAP. Weaned from 10L O2 to 6L O2, afebrile, and sent to 
floor ___ on Vanc/zosyn.  Did well on floor. kept on broad abx 
since no sputum was able to be collected for cx (bronch too high 
risk). Plan to treat with 10days of Abx. Sent to ___ for 
further care, Abx, monitoring of Hypoxia, f/u imaging. 
.
.
Please see progress note below for details on hospital course 
and plan for each medical illness: 
.
.
Community Acquired Pneumonia: significant consolidation on CT 
___ associated with hypoxia. On broad Abx (vanc, zosyn, 
azithro). Were unable to get sputum for resp cx and bronch too 
high risk (esp given hypoxia) so will keep broad Abx for 10day 
course. 
- today is day ___ of Vanc/zosyn. Can d/c azithro today. 
-keep on 6L O2, titrate to keep sats around 93% (monitor with 
activity, which is when he desaturates). He may need screening 
for outpt O2 for some time, however should see some decrease in 
requirements 
-since he is still coughing w/o much sputum production, will 
change him from duonebs to albuterol + mucomyst nebs q4, 
guaifenesin. 
-he should be on incentive spirometer and OOB and ambulating as 
tolerated. 
-there was some concern for post for postobstructive PNA given 
severity, but will w/u with bronch only if pt fails to improve 
on current regimen (monitor O2 requirements). he needs f/u 
imaging for resolving infiltrate in ___ 
-note legionella was negative. Also CTA negative for PE.

regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well 
seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

History of Present Illness:
  This is a ___ F transfer from ___, recent diagnosis of 
bilateral cryptogenic pneumonia, PMR, Afib, NSTEMI last week, 
cath with 3VD,  sCHF (EF 45%), who initially presented with 
fever and respiratory  distress to BI-N. 

On ___, patient presented to her PCP appearing ill with an 
increased O2 requirement up to 4L NC (baseline 1.5L NC) at rest 
___ wheelchair. Exam was notable for diffuse crackles. Given 
worsened hypoxemia, pulmonary fellow and PCP agreed to place 
patients on prednisone 20mg daily (low dose given high risk for 
sCHF exacerbation for recent diagnosis of organizing pneumonia 
with PCP prophylaxis with plans for close f/u. Patient 
reportedly had fever 101.8 with no associated cough. Review of 
systems was otherwise negative for any chest pain, shortness of 
breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or dysuria per family 
members. 

The next day, she subsequently presented to BI-N with worsening 
respiratory distress that evening. Initial O2 saturations were 
___ the ___, improved with NRB 100%. Patient was unable to 
tolerate BiPaP. Her initially SBPs were ___ but improved 
with IVF (total 4L IVF) and started levophed (not recorded ___ 
notes). She was also febrile to 101. Labs were notable for BNP 
2900 with lactate 3.5. ED stay was complicated by afib with rvr 
to 160s which improved to 120s with fluid and adminsitration of 
tylenol. Patient was given 10mg po Vitamin K and 5mg IV Vit K 
for INR 7. She was also given vanc/zosyn for presumed hcap. 
Patient was subsequently noted to become hypoxic to 90 with rr50 
- exam findings were concerning for pulmonary edema for which 
patient was intubated. She did sustain a small inner lip 
laceration during intubation. She was then transferred to ___ 
with vitals on transfer:
98.9 temporal 135 afib, 46rr, 94% 15LPM non-rebreather, 95/62 
(after 1000mg PR APAP).  

Of note, patient was recently hospitalized ___ for NSTEMI 
and atrial fibrillation. She was started on heparin drip and 
then taken for a left cardiac catheterization which revealed 
complex 3 vessel disease (please see ___ cath report). CABG 
was recommended, but the patient was very resistant and 
preferred to wait. The cardiology team reviewed the upfront 
mortality risk of CABG vs risk of recurrent MI and heart 
failure. Ultimately it was determined that she should be 
monitored as an outpatient. TTE showed an LVEF 45% mild regional 

left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and 
infero-lateral hypokinesis suggested as well as mild aortic 
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The patient was started 
on Aspirin 81mg, metoprolol succinate 75mg BID, and Lisinopril 
2.5mg. She was started on lovenox as part of medical management 
of afib (5 day course, Last day ___, outreach call 
was made with INR 2.5 for which recommendation was made to 
discontinue enoxaparin and continue warfarin 2.5mg alternating 
with warfarin 5mg. Of note, she was discharged 93-95% on room 
air HR ___ 100s and home oxygen PRN.  Bactrim and prednisone for 
cryptogenic pneumonia recently diagnosed were held on discharge 
___ the setting of NSTEMI and improved oxygenation. 

She was also admitted to ___ (___) for dyspnea and 
malaise, and - this was the admission during which she was 
diagnosed with cryptogenic pneumonia based on lung biopsy. 
Patient was on prednisone 40mg daily only from ___ to ___ since 
it was discontinued on subsequent admission.

Today 21:17 0 99.4 140 78/56 25 72% Intubation 
 
Labs were notable for wbc 22.3 with h/h ___ (11.2/34.7) and 
INR 4.3. Initial ABG showed 7.___/50 on 50% FiO2 with mixed 
venous O2 97 and lactate 2.0. ABG prior to transfer showed 
___ on 100% FiO2.

U/a with neg leuk, neg nitrite, few bacteria, and 1 wbc. 

Vent settings were A/C with FiO2 100%, PEEP 5, TV 400, RR30 
showing abg 7.___.

Left CVL and NGT were placed ___ ED and patient was started on 
Levophed 0.25mcg/kg/min

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with history of HTN, HL, a. fib on chronic 
anti-coagulation with BRBPR.
.
# BRBPR- The patient has a history of diverticular bleeding in 
___. He was initially admitted to ___ in 
___ with a Hct of 24.8 and INR of 1.5 and reports of BRBPR 
x wks. He was hemodynamically stable. He continued to pass clots 
per rectum and was transfused with 4U PRBCs and his INR was 
reversed. A tagged red cell scan was performed, which showed 
active bleeding. Surgery was consulted at the OSH and determined 
the patient was not a surgical candidate so the patient was 
transferred to ___ for ___ embolization. At ___, the patient 
continued to pass BRBPR (clots) and he was transfused an 
additional unit. ___ took the patient for possible embolization 
but did not see any active bleeding so no intervention was 
performed. GI was consulted and performed a colonoscopy which 
did not show any active areas of hemorrhage, but did show 
multiple polyps, diverticulosis, and possible ischemic colitis. 
GI recommended an outpatient colonoscopy. The patient remained 
hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit during his 
entire ___ admission. The patient was instructed to follow-up 
with his PCP for GI referral for colonoscopy. On the day of d/c, 
the patient's Hct was 27.1 with INR 1.4. 
.
# A. fib - The patient's home medication verapamil was stopped 
out of concern for GI bleeding and hypotension; metoprolol 50 mg 
TID was continued. On ___, the patient had an episode of Atrial 
fibrillation with RVR and required 10 mg IV Diltiazem pushed. He 
was started on 40 mg PO Verapamil TID. He was discharged on his 
home medication Verapamil 180 mg SR qd. The patient was 
instructed and the rehab facility was notified that he should 
restart coumadin on ___. The patient's daughter, also his 
health care proxy, was made aware of the risks and benefits of 
restarting anticoagulation. She expressed interest in speaking 
with the patient's PCP about the issue. 
.
# HTN- Anti-hypertensives were intially held but were restarted 
during the patient's admission. His pressures remained stable 
during the admission. 
.
# HL- The patient was continued on his home statin. 
.
# Recurrent UTIs - The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs 
associated with his chronic in-dwelling foley catheter, which he 
has had for ___ years. His foley was changed in the hospital and 
he reports it is changed at home each month. The patient was 
intially started on antibiotics at the OSH for his UTI but these 
were stopped because the patient was asymptomatic and there is 
concern for propagating resistant infections. 
.
#IDDM: The patient was kept on sliding scale insulin during this 
admission. His insulin requirements were much lower than his 
listed home doses of Lantus 16U qam, and 19U qpm. He was 
discharged on 10 U qpm but may require up-titration depending on 
his blood sugars. 
.
The patient was maintained on heparin SC BID for DVT 
prophylaxis. His code status was DNR/DNI. Communication was with 
the patient and his wife, daughter - his health care proxy, and 
son-in-law. Physical therapy worked with the patient and felt it 
was in his best interest to go to rehab to regain strength prior 
to going home.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___. You were diagnosed with a lower 
Gastrointestinal bleed, for which you were intially treated at 
___ in ___ before transfer to ___. 
Your blood pressure was never dangerously low, but you were 
transfused with 5 units of blood and your blood-thinning 
medication (Coumadin) was stopped and its effects were reversed.

You had a tagged red cell scan at ___, which 
indicated active bleeding and since it was felt that surgery was 
not in your best interest, you were transferred to ___ for 
further management. Here, our radiologists did a study and did 
not see evidence of active bleeding. Because you did continue to 
have lower GI bleeding w/ clots, our gastroenterology team was 
consulted; they performed a colonoscopy, which showed evidence 
of diverticulosis, multiple small colon polyps, and possible 
evidence of ischemic colitis. They recommended a repeat 
colonoscopy as an outpatient. Your red blood cell count remained 
stable during your entire admission at ___. 

On ___, you had a very fast heart rate due to your atrial 
fibrillation. You were placed back on your home medication 
verapamil and also received IV medication to help slow your 
heart rate. 

We made the following changes to your medications: 
We STOPPED coumadin due to your GI bleeding; further guidance 
regarding this medication is discussed below
We STOPPED Plaquenil as it was not clear whether you had an 
indication for this treatment and did not think you were taking 
this at home
We CHANGED your Lasix from 80 mg once per day to 40 mg once per 
day; you should weigh yourself daily and if your weight 
increases more than 3 lbs over 2 days, you may need to increase 
this dose back to 80 mg once per day
We CHANGED your Lantus dose from 16 U in the morning and 19U in 
the evening to 10 U in the evening- in addition to sliding scale 
insulin; depending on your blood sugar checks, your Lantus dose 
may need to be increased
We continued your Aspirin 81 mg each day, Ativan 0.5 mg each 
night as needed for sleep, Verapamil 180 mg SR each morning, 
Simvastatin 80 mg each day and Metoprolol 50 mg three times per 
day
We STOPPED your Novolog 
.
*You should restart your coumadin on ___ at 5 mg per day. You 
should have your INR routinely checked in addition to your CBC. 
Because being on coumadin does increase your risk for GI bleeds, 
any concerns regarding re-starting this medication should be 
discussed with your primary care doctor and your daughter. We 
spoke with your daughter and she was made aware of the risks and 
benefits of restarting coumadin. It may also be beneficial for 
your goal INR to be from 1.5 to 2.5 instead of 2 to 3.*

You will see a doctor at the rehab facility. When you are 
discharged from rehab, you should make an appointment with your 
PCP, ___ and you should have him help refer you 
to a GI doctor for ___ colonoscopy.

IMAGING:
CT HEAD:
FINDINGS: 
  
There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or acute large 
territory infarct.  
Prominent ventricles and sulci compatible with age-related 
involutional 
change.  The basal cisterns appear patent and there is 
preservation of 
gray-white matter differentiation.  No acute fracture is 
identified.  Old 
fixation hardware is seen along the left maxillary bone.  A 
mucous retention 
cyst is visualized left maxillary sinus as well as left frontal 
sinus.  The 
mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear.  The globes 
are 
unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
No acute intracranial process. 

CT ABDOMEN PELVIS/CTA CHEST
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. No acute thoracic, abdominal or pelvic process.   
  
2. Multiple findings suggestive of congestive heart failure 
including 
cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, and there is third 
spacing of fluid 
in the mesentery and soft tissues. 
  
3. Multiple vertebral body compression fractures with the L3 
fracture new 
since prior exam on ___.  Severe bilateral 
glenohumeral joint 
degenerative changes with associated effusion sequestering in 
the subscapular 
space. 
  
4. 7 mm hypodensity in the pancreatic body. MRCP recommended.    

  
5. Cholelithiasis. 
  
6. Multinodular enlarged thyroid appearing roughly stable from 
___. 

MRI SPINE:
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Compression deformities as above, most strikingly involving 
the L1 
vertebral body where there is mild retropulsion of the superior 
aspect of that 
vertebral body.  However, this does not result in severe spinal 
canal stenosis 
at this (or any other fractured) level.  
2.  Degenerative changes as catalog above, including moderately 
severe spinal 
canal narrowing at L4-L5.  
3.  Extensive lobulated T2 hyperintensity surrounding the 
glenohumeral joints 
bilaterally, appearing septated in areas. This is incompletely 
evaluated 
though likely represents large joint effusions or adjacent 
bursal fluid 
collections.  

MRCP:
IMPRESSION: 
1.  1.2-cm cystic pancreatic lesion in the pancreatic body, most 
likely 
representing a side branch ___.  Envisioning the patient's age 
and size of 
the lesion a followup MRI exam in one year is recommended to 
ensure stability. 
2.  Cholecystolithiasis with a focal area of fundal 
adenomyomatosis. 
3.  Moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion. 
4.  Right upper pole renal cysts. 

L SPINE PLAIN FILM
FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is a compression fracture 
of L1 with 
associated fracture at T12 and extensive bridging osteophytes, 
suggesting that 
this represents an old injury.  An apparent acute compression 
fracture is seen 
at L3.  There may be slight anterolisthesis at the L3-4 level. 
  
There is marked narrowing at L4-5 and L5-S1, consistent with 
substantial 
degenerative changes.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for shortness of breath and chest 
pain.  While you were here, you were found to have too much 
fluid, including it being in your chest, lungs, and legs.  We 
gave you lasix for this and you lost a significant amount of 
water weight.  You should continue to take Lasix daily, and 
follow up with your primary care doctor about this medication.  
You should have your blood drawn on ___ to check your 
electrolytes.

You also were found to have compression fractures of your spine, 
and orthopedic surgery saw you.  They recommend you wear a brace 
anytime you are out of bed.  You should see them in follow up in 
the next few weeks.

You were also found to have a small mass in your pancreas.  An 
MRI was performed which recommended that you have a repeat in ___ 
year.  Please talk with your primary care doctor about this 
lesion, called ___ (Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm).  
There is no urgent need to do anything about this.

You were also found to have high blood pressure your last two 
days here when you did not receive lasix.  Your fludricortisone 
may be making your blood pressure high.  You should speak with 
your PCP regarding the need for more blood pressure medications.

Chest xray on ___ showed moderate pleural effusions but 
appeared euvolemic.  Her BNP remained elevated at over 4000.  
She was to start Lasix 20 mg every other day as of ___ 
but this was not picked up from the pharmacy.  Repeat 
echocardiogram done on ___ showed a low normal left 
ventricular systolic function(LVEF 50-55%). 

Ms. ___ and ___ her husband report that day prior to admission 
she had episode of diarrhea that came on suddenly.  She could 
not make it to the bathroom in time.  She had repeat episode the

DIAGNOSIS: 

FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT 
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING 
The following tests (antibodies) were performed ___, ___-7, 
kappa, lambda and CD antigens 3,5,10,19,20,23 and 45.

RESULTS:
Three color Gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to 
optimize lymphocyte yield. CD45-bright, low side scatter gated 
lymphocytes comprise 58% of total analyzed events. B cells are 
scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality. T cells 
comprise 97% of lymphoid gated events and express mature lineage 
antigens CD3, CD5. 

INTERPRETATION
Nonspecific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic 
immunophenotypic features of involvement by non-Hodgkin B-cell 
lymphoma are not seen in specimen. Correlation wit clinical 
findings is recommended. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may 
not detect all abnormal populations due to topography, sampling 
or artifacts of sample preparation.

Imaging:
========
CT chest ___: 
Increased bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, 
is the only suggestion of intrathoracic malignancy.  No 
adenopathy or lung nodules. New mild alveolar opacification, 
anterior segment of the upper lobes, right greater than left, of 
uncertain significance. This could be residual edema, pulmonary 
hemorrhage, or early infection. Is probably not lymphoma.
 
Mid thoracic vertebral compression fracture stable new since ___, stable since ___. No no other bone lesions.
 
Atherosclerotic calcification involving at least the left 
circumflex coronary artery.

MRI head ___: 
1. No acute infarct or suspicious focus of hemorrhage or focus 
of abnormalenhancement in the brain parenchyma or meninges.
2. Nonspecific white matter changes described above, which are 
compatible with small vessel ischemic disease in patient of this 
age.

Lung Scan ___: IMPRESSION: Matched ventilation/perfusion 
defects with airways disease predominating.  Low likelihood 
ratio for acute pulmonary embolism.

Echocardiogram ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal hypokinesis. There 
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly 
directed jet of Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade. 

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. 
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation directed posteriorly. 
Bilateral pleural effusions. Small pericardial effusion without 
evidence of tamponade physiology. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar. 

CTA CHEST ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2.  Interval decrease in right sided pleural effusion when 
compared to most recent examination dated ___.  
Right sided pigtail catheter noted. 
3.  Peribronchial ground glass opacities re-demonstrated, 
predominantly within the right upper lobe, which appears less 
conspicuous on current examination.  Differential remains the 
same and includes edema, pulmonary hemorrhage or early 
infection. 
4.  No appreciable adenopathy. 
5.  Stable mild thoracic vertebral compression fracture. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with history of follicular lymphoma, grade  II/III, 
recenntly d/c'd for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (day ___) who initially presented from clinic 
with diarrhea, orthopnea, and rash found to have E. Coli and VRE 
bacteremia, heart failure exacerbation, and altered mental 
status all of which resolved prior to discharge.

# Diastolic heart failure, Orthopnea, and Hypoxia:  
Patient presented with orthopnea and lower extremity edema 
concerning for diastolic heart failure exacerbation. BNP noted 
to be elevated. CXR and CT noted to have  pleural effusions with 
small pericardial effusion. V/Q scan obtained that ruled out PE. 
Patient diuresed with 40 mg IV lasix daily until euvolemic. 
Patient also received bilateral thorocentesis that was 
consistent with transudative process in setting of diastolic 
heart failure. Repeat TTE was obtained that showed small 
pericardial effusion though no tamponade physiology with normal 
EF. PO lasix 20 mg every other day was started prior to 
discharge. Patient noted to have 2L oxygen requirement 
throughout most of hospital course that improved to RA prior to 
discharge. The patient will follow up in cardiology clinic on 
___.

# Pleural Effusions, transudative in nature:
Patient noted to have bilateral pleural effusions that responded 
to some degree with diuresis. Patient also received bilateral 
thoracentesis for drainage. Thoracentesis studies were 
consistent with transudative process in setting of CHF above and 
did not show any evidence of infection or lymphoma. CTA chest 
obtained to rule out PE or pleural based process as etiology of 
effusions. Right upper lobe finding on CT chest thought to be 
consistent with pulmonary edema secondary to MR regurgitant jet. 
Patient followed closely by pulmonary as inpatient who suggested 
repeat CT chest with contrast in ___ weeks or sooner if clinical 
change occurs. Should there be persistent or worsened 
abnormalities on chest CT then patient should then be seen in 
general pulmonary clinic. Pulmonary also recommended repeat full 
PFTs (spirometry with bronchodilator testing, DLCO, lung 
volumes) when approaches euvolemic and stable. Also suggested 
follow-up in interventional pulmonary ___ clinic if 
re-accumulation of effusions.

# Complicated UTI: E. coli and VRE positive urine culture 
Patient noted to have E. Coli and VRE positive urine culture 
with resistance to ceftriaxone and cefepime. Patient was treated 
with Meropenem 1000 mg IV Q12H for gram negative and gram 
positive coverage as well as Daptomycin 250 mg IV Q24H for VRE 
coverage. Patient had left ureteral stent replaced during 
hospital course on ___ and as such meropenum and daptomycin 
were continued until one day post-op. She remained afebrile in 
the week prior to discharge following cessation of antibiotics.

#Follicular lymphoma, grade  II/III s/p allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (day 65). CMV and EBV viral loads were 
monitored weekly. Patient was placed on prophylaxis with 
atovaquone, fluconazole, and valgancyclovir. Given anemia and 
thrombocytopenia patient had repeat peripheral smear chimerism 
study as well as bone marrow biopsy to evaluate the status of 
her graft. These studies were pending at time of discharge and 
should be followed up. The preliminary read for the bone marrow 
biopsy at time of discharge was not consistent with process that 
would require further hospitalization.

#Neutropenia
The patient was noted to be neutropenic on day of discharge with 
ANC of ~500. It was thought that this could be secondary to drug 
effect from buproprion vs. valgancyclovir. Neupogen was started 
on day of discharge to follow up counts in clinic on follow up 
and to consider repeat neupogen dosing as needed. In addition it 
was thought that buproprion could also gradually be tapered to 
eliminate its potential side effect of leukopenia.

# Poor PO intake/ Hypoalbumin: Patient noted to have poor PO 
intake and to be malnourished during hospital course. Nutrition 
followed patient and suggested calorie count with encouragement 
of 1500 calories/day. Her PO intake improved in the week prior 
to discharge. 

# Altered Mental Status: 
Patient noted to have altered mental status initially on 
admission and throughout first part of hospital course. MRI head 
obtained that was within normal limits. LP also obtained and was 
unrevealing. Some concern for cyclosporin toxicity and as such 
levels were closely monitored and adjusted accordingly. In 
addition doses of patient's gabapentin, oxycodone, and oxycontin 
were all decreased as well that was also thought to contribute 
to resolution of patient's altered mental status. These lower 
doses were continued at time of discharge. In addition patient's 
cyclosporin level was checked every ___ days and seemed to have 
no effect on patient's mental status when in the 200-215 range. 
Patient's mental status improved back to baseline prior to 
discahrge. 

# Acute Kidney Injury/ Left Hydronephrosis:
Patient with noted ___ on admission in setting of known 
hydronephrosis on left, which is where urethral stent is located 
(placed ___. Urology consulted who felt that 
replacement of stent was non-urgent but that it could be 
complicated when patient was optimized from volume status. Once 
patient was optimally diuresed she had replacement of her 
ureteral stent on ___ without complication. Perioperative 
meropenum and daptomycin were continued in setting of her known 
complicated UTI. Patient's renal function returned to normal in 
the weeks prior to discharge. Her operative report was requested 
to be sent to her ___ urologist Dr. ___ fax #: 
___. 

#Hematuria:
Patient has known hematuria that has been worked up as much as 
it can be given that she is post transplant. It was noted to 
resolve prior to discharge. Please follow up hematuria
 
# CMV viremia:
Patient noted to have CMV viremia. Viral loads were checked 
weekly and noted to downtrend and were undetectable on ___. 
Patient initially on gancyclovir IV dosing that was then 
transitioned to PO dosing of 450 mg twice daily. It was thought 
that valgancyclovir should be continued for 1 week following 
undetectable levels until ___. The patient was discharged 
with twice a day dosing to complete on ___. Repeat CMV 
viral load should be checked on ___ to ensure it remains 
undetectable.   
 
# Diarrhea: 
Mrs. ___ was noted to have 3 episodes of sudden onset diarrhea 
associated with fatigue on admission. Given proximity to allo 
stem cell transplant there was concern for acute GVHD. Other 
possible sources of diarrhea included CMV colitis, c. diff, and 
other bacterial infections as causative agents explored though 
all were negative (see results section, stool studies). Patient 
also noted that at baseline she had diarrhea and stool 
incontinence prior to hospital course secondary to pelvic 
radiation. 

# Rash: 
Patient presented with rash on legs that was concerning 
intitially for GVHD vs. rash of stasis. Rash noted to improve 
with diuresis and was thought to most likely be secondary to 
stasis. On ___ patient noted to have maculopapular rash on 
arms and legs without involvment of back or abdomen. Dermatology 
was consulted and felt patient's rash was most likely petichial 
in nature in setting of thrombocytopenia and did not biopsy. 
Rash was monitored with significant improvement in the days 
prior to discharge. As needed aquaphor was used with improvement 
of rash and continued on discharge. 
 
# Transaminitis
Patient with initial transaminitis in hepatocellular pattern. 
Initial concern for GVHD though thought to be less likely given 
normal bilirubin levels. Most likely cause of transaminitis waws 
thought to be possible drug effect. Transaminases were trended 
throughout hospital course and noted to be downtrending and 
returned within normal limit in the week prior to discharge. 

# Hypothyroidism:
Levothyroxine was continued

# Back pain: 
She has known pathologic fracture from likely prior lymphomatous 
involvement of L3 vertebral end plate. Evaluated by spine 
surgery prior to admission with plan for nonsurgical management. 
Back brace, oxycodone and oxycontin (decreased dose), as well as 
gabapentin continued throughout hospital course for pain 
control. 

# GERD: 
Pantoprazole continued throughout hospital course

# Depression:
Buproprion continued throughout hospital course.

.
Coronary Catheterization ___:
COMMENTS:      
1. Selective native coronary angiography in this right dominant 
system 
demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had 
mild distal 
plaquing.  The LAD was proximally occluded.  The ramus 
intermedius had 
a 60% ostial lesion, and an 80% lesion prior to a bifircation 
which 
appeared slightly worse than on prior angiography. The LCX had a 
65% 
lesion in its mid segment.  The AV groove LCX demonstrated a 
likely 
recanalized tubular total occlusion between the OM2 and OM4, 
spanning 
the origin of OM3.  The AV groove LCX also supplied a OM4 and 
OM5/LPL 
branches, and the distal AV groove LCX and LPL gave off 
collaterals to 
the distal RCA.  The RCA had mild proximal tapering, a 50% 
lesion in its 
mid segment, and a 55% lesion in its distal segment before 
widely patent 
stents.  There was TIMI 2 slow flow noted.  The distal right PDA 
had 
diffuse disease in both poles up to 50% in the septal pole. 
2. Non-selective arterial conduit angiography demonstrated the 
LIMA to 
LAD to be patent proximally and in the graft.  The anastamosis 
to the 
LAD was not visualized well with non-selective injection.  
Selective 
LIMA angiography was deferred to save contrast. 
3. The proximal left subclavian was tortuous with a ___rterial pressure in the left subclavian artery was 138/68 mmHg 
(mean 96 
mmHg).  There was no gradient between the central aorta and left 

subclavian artery. 
4. Selective venous conduit angiography of the single 
SVG-diagonal graft 
demonstrated a 70% in-stent restenosis in the mid segment and a 
90% 
distal edge restenosis of the proximal stent.  There was a 360 
degree 
bend mid graft with a 50% proximal edge in-stent restenosis mid 
loop, 
and a distal edge 85% lesion at the efferent/distal end of the 
loop. 
There was with diffuse mild plaquing in the SVG beyond feeding a 
modest 
caliber diagonal.  The SVG to PDA graft was known to be totally 
occluded 
on prior angiography. 
5. Left heart catheterization revealed a midly elevated LVEDP of 
17 
mmHg.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve with 
carefull 
pullback.  There was mild systemic arterial hypertension with a 
centrae 
of 78 mmHg. 
6. Given the challenging nature of PCI to the SVG to diagnoal 
from a 
left radial approach due to poor guide support and difficult 
catheter 
control, a decision was made to proceede with PCI via a left 
femoral 
arterial approach (plan was to avoid the right femoral artery 
due to 
prior RFA laceration).  At this point, the patient stated that 
he was 
having a lot of left shoulder discomfort, and was uncertain that 
he 
could tolerate much more of the procedure.  Plan for PCI was 
reviewed 
with the patient who requested deferral of the PCI to another 
day.  A 
plan was made to return for PCI of the SVG-diagnoal via the LFA 
via a 7 
___ AL2 guiding catheter. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease with some 
progression in 
the ramus intermedius. 
2. Severe edge and in-stent restenosis of the SVG-diagnoal. 
3. Tortuous left subclavian artery. 
4. Patent proximal and body of the LIMA to LAD. 
5. Mild left ventricular diastolic heart failure. 
6. Mild systemic arterial hypertension. 
7. Plan for PCI of the SVG-diagonal in ___ days via the LFA. 
.
Coronary Catheterization ___:
Coronary angiography:  
SVG-Diagonal:  Diffuse disease with extremely tortuous  vessel
and 360 degree loop.  With several 60-90% restenotic lesions in
the proximal and mid graft.  Mild luminal irregularities and
ectasia in the remaining graft proximal to the touchdown.

Interventional details
Change for 7 ___ AL-2.  Crossed with ChoICE ___ Floppy wire
into the diagonal.  Crossed with a ___ Grafix Intermediate wire
into the diagonal as a ""buddy wire"".  Predilated with a 2.5 mm
balloon.  Unable to deliver a stent around the 360 degree loop 
to
the 70% mid vessel lesion.  Deployed a 2.5 x 12 mm Resolute 
stent
and then a more proximal overlapping 2.5 x 14 mm Resolute stent
in the ostium.    Now delivered a Guideliner daughter catheter 
to
the proximal portion of the loop but unable to deliver stents.  
A
mid graft dissection was treated with inflation of a 2.5 mm
balloon.  With the balloon inflated as an ""Anchor"" the 
Guideliner
was delivered around the ___ 2.5 x 14 mm 
Resolute
stent was then deployed repairing the mid vessel dissection and 
a
more proximal overlapping 2.5 x 18 mm Resolute stent was 
deployed
repairing the  mid vessel 70% lesion.  All stents were
postdilated with a 2.75 mm balloon.  Final angiography revealed
normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the
stents.  The patient had chest pain during the procedure but 
left
the laboratory in stable condition.   A distal cutoff of a small
diagonal branch was noted but it was unclear whether this was a
new or old finding.

Assessment & Recommendations
1.ASA indefinitely
2.Plavix 75 mg POQD x 12 months uninterrupted, likely lifelong
3.Secondary prevention CAD.
 
Brief Hospital Course:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you! You were admitted to ___ 
for evaluation and treatment of chest pain/angina. You were 
found to have some mild EKG changes but lab testing did not 
reveal any elevation in your cardiac enzymes suggesting there 
was no damage to your heart muscle. You also had a CT angiogram 
of your chest which did not reveal damage to your aorta or a 
clot that traveled to your lungs. You underwent coronary 
catheterizations (the first by your wrist, the second by your 
groin) which showed multiple narrowings of one of your vein 
grafts which was repaired with 4 drug-eluting stents. You had a 
low grade fever prior to discharge but no symptoms concerning 
for infection. If you begin developing fevers, cough, pain with 
urination, irritation of your skin, or diarrhea, please schedule 
an appointment with your primary care doctor. The low grade 
fever can sometimes be a response to a procedure such as a 
catheterization, and in these cases it is nothing to worry 
about. Because of this, we feel you are safe to be discharged 
home.

The following changes have been made to your medications:
-START Plavix 75mg by mouth once daily (You must stay on this 
medication for ___ year to prevent clots from forming in your 
stents)
-Continue your other medications as previously prescribed

Please ___ with the appointments as listed below.

Brief Hospital Course:
# UTI: Pt presented with Ecoli UTI that was resistant to Cipro. 
She was switched to Ceftriaxone and then should complete a 10day 
course of po Cefpodoxime. She remained afebrile in house with a 
stable WBC ct.  Plan to continue Cefpodoxime 200mg BID day for 
an additional 7 days to complete a 10 day course.
.  
# AF: Pt denies prior diagnosis of AF and this occurred in 
setting of acute illness.  However, given CHADs score of 4, pt 
will benefit from anti-coagulation for stroke prevention and she 
agreed to this treatment plan.  Pt was started on Coumadin and 
INR on day of discharge was 2.8. Recommend continuing Coumadin 
1mg daily with follow up INR to be drawn on ___.  Metoprolol 
was increased to 125mg BID for rate/BP control.
.
# Acute Systolic Heart failure:  Pt with depressed EF of 40% and 
2+MR presented with ARF and lasix was held, gentle IVF 
administered for 2 days.  Pt then began hypertensive with new 
oxygen requirement & bilateral effusions that had been seen on 
prior admissions.  Pt was gently diuresed with goal to wean from 
supplemental oxygen. Pt should continue Lasix 20mg daily with 
Lisinopril 20mg daily & increased Metoprolol 125mg BID. Please 
continue to tritrate lasix as needed until patient stable on 
room air.
.
# Hypertension: Pt developped poorly controlled BPs after lasix 
was held for 2 days and gentle IVF administration.  Suspect that 
rising BP was due to volume overload, after gentle diuresis and 
resuming home anti-hypertensive regimen, BP was much better 
controlled.  Pt should continue Lasix 20mg daily Lisinopril 20mg 
daily & increased Metoprolol 125mg BID.
.  
# CAD/Trop elevation: Pt had troponin leak after the episode of 
AFib with RVR and in the setting of UTI & ARF. Pt was noted to 
have some demand related EKG changes when in Afib with RVR but 
denied any symptoms. EKG was back at baseline after conversion 
to NSR. ECHO was unchanged from prior studies with depressed EF 
of 40%, MR & TR. Cards was curbsided due troponin peak of 0.31 
and they agreed that this was likely demand related troponin 
leak in setting of ARF. Pt likely has underlying CAD with flow 
limiting lesions, but pt clearly expressed goal to avoid any 
intervention including cath and the plan is for ongoing medical 
management of CAD.  Metoprolol was increased to 125mg BID and pt 
was continued on ASA, statin and Lisinopril.  
.  
# Acute renal failure: Pt presented with creatinine of 1.4 up 
from baseline of 0.9. Lasix & ACE were held and this resolved 
with gentle IVF. Pt was restarted on Lasix & ACE and creatinine 
remained stable at 1.1.
.  
# Anemia: Hematocrit was noted to have trended down from 38 to 
low ___ and iron studies revealed a Fe/TIBC ratio of <15%.  Pt 
was started on Ferrous Sulfate 325mg with bowel regimen. There 
was no report of guaic positive stools but recommend outpt GI 
follow up.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted on ___ for cardiac 
catheterization and heparin bridge in preparation for surgery. 
Cardiac catheterization was significant for anomalous LMCA 
arising from the right cusp. Does not appear to be an 
inter-arterial course. There was no angiographically apparent 
coronary artery disease. He remained hemodynamically stable 
overnight and was taken to the operating room the following day. 
He underwent a mitral valve repair, MAZE, left atrial appendage 
ligation on ___. Please see operative note for full 
details. Post operative he was taken to the intensive care unit 
on Propofol and levophed.  Within a few hours he was weaned off 
Propofol, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated without 
complications.  
Early post operative day one he was weaned off levophed and 
later started on betablocker and diuretic.  Additionally he was 
started on amiodarone for MAZE.  He was transitioned to the 
floor. Chest tubes and epicardial wires were removed per 
protocol.  He was monitored on telemetry and noted for PVC with 
junctional beat after then sinus rhythm then developed atrial 
fibrillation/flutter which betablocker and amiodarone had been 
adjusted. He was started on coumadin for anticoagulation. EP was 
consulted due to persistent atrial flutter. They did a TEE which 
did not show any intra cardiac thrombus and he was successfully 
electrically cardioverted from  atrial flutter to sinus rhythm 
on ___. He worked with physical therapy on strength and 
mobility with recommendation for home with services.  He was 
clinically stable for discharge home on post operative day 8 in 
stable condition. All follow up appointments were arranged. 
Coumadin follow up was arranged with ___ 
clinic.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with history of inferior MI s/p PCI of RCA in 
___, HTN, chronic atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban, stage III 
CKD (baseline Cr 1.2-1.4), and anemia presented to ___ 
on ___ with acute on chronic worsening of shortness of breath 
for 5 days. This was associated with lethargy, anorexia, chills, 
and subjective increased thirst with increased urination and 
diarrhea.

A CT chest showed a mediastinal mas causing narrowing of the 
right mainstem bronchus with associated right upper lobe 
collapse. It also noted right middle lobe and right lower lobe 
pneumonia, for which she was initially treated with Augmentin.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient has had increased oxygen 
requirement requiring 50%VM, nonrebreather, and high-flow nasal 
canula at various times. She also had atrial fibrillation with 
RVR that initially improved with IV metoprolol 5mg, however 
recurred. Because of the worsening hypoxemia and heart rates, 
the patient was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring. 
In the ICU, she was placed on a dilt gtt for RVR. She was 
broadened to vancomycin and zosyn given increasing WBC (15 --> 
21 over the last two days) and O2 requirement. Also of note, she 
was previously on a heparin gtt but this was reportedly stopped 
for on the day of transfer at 0815 in preparation for possible 
invasive procedures.

Given the above, the patient was transferred to ___ where she 
will undergo bronchoscopy with biopsy per IP.

PERTINENT FINDINGS:
===================
___ CT INTERVENTIAL PROCEDURE
Successful CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal gland nodule, 
with 4 core 
biopsy specimens sent for pathology. ___ immediate postprocedural 

complications. 

___ CT ABD W/ CONTRAST
1. The left adrenal nodule demonstrates washout characteristics 
most 
consistent with a benign adenoma.  This carries a specificity of 
92% according to the reference below. 
2. Pancreatic cystic lesion is most in keeping with side-branch 
IPMN and can be re-evaluated at next follow-up imaging. 
___, et al.  Adrenal masses: 
characterization with combined unenhanced and delayed enhanced 
CT. Radiology ___ ___ 

___ MRI RENAL W/O CONTRAST
Suboptimal imaging due to the patient's inability to breath 
hold. Dynamic 
contrast-enhanced adrenal CT is advised to assess adrenal 
enhancement 
characteristics to differentiate between an adenoma or a 
malignant/metastatic lesion. 

___ FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET-CT)
1. Complete collapse of the right upper lobe with rightward 
mediastinal shift demonstrating FDG avidity and FDG avid 
consolidation in the right middle and lower lobe and FDG avid 
opacity in the left upper lobe concerning for metastatic 
disease.  Additional pulmonary nodules and opacities in the left 
lung are not FDG avid and some may be too small to be evaluated 
for uptake. 
2. Multiple FDG avid enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are also 
noted. 
3. A left adrenal 1.7 cm nodule demonstrates FDG avidity with 
SUV max of 3.9 concerning for metastatic disease. 
4. Right mainstem bronchus is patent status post stenting. 

___ CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
Right mainstem bronchus is patent.  Increased consolidation and 
volume loss with air bronchograms in the right lower lobe 
suggesting combination of atelectasis and probably pneumonia.  
Mild improvement in right middle lobe opacification.  New 
ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe, probably 
infectious.  Slight short-term increase in mediastinal nodes, 
probably reactive in context; short-term increase in malignant 
infiltration seems less likely. 

___ Second Opinion CT TORSO
1. Severe right middle and lower lobe atelectasis is partially 
visualized, 
better seen on the reference CT chest from ___.  
Moderate left 
pleural effusion. 
2. 2.1 x 1.6 cm left adrenal nodule is likely an adenoma but 
just above 
density threshold to be more definitive ___ ___.  A 3 month 
followup is 
recommended (either CT or MRI) to assess for any interval change 
in size. 
3. Noncontrast technique is suboptimal abdominal/pelvic staging. 
 If renal 
function is prohibitive for an oncology CT protocol, consider 
PET/CT for 
staging; the adrenal nodule could also be further assessed at 
that time. 

___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
Diffuse opacification of the right lung has progressed and could 
reflect 
combination of increased large right effusion and underlying 
atelectasis and infiltrates.

___ Pulm/Sleep Pulmonary/Rigid Bronchoscopy 
Mixed (endobronchial/extrinsic compression) disease at the light 
mainstem ~95% occlusion. RUL was obliterated.

___ MR ___ (OSH)
___ evidence of metastatic disease on the basis of this 
noncontrast exam.
 
___ CT abdomen (OSH)
1. There is a 19 x 19 mm left adrenal nodule with a CT value   
 of 11.4 CT units. This is not a definite adenoma. The patient 
is not a   
 candidate for renal protocol due to   
 renal function. Therefore this nodule at this time is 
indeterminate.   
 Would recommend follow-up examination in ___ months as 
clinically   
 indicated.   
 2. Other findings as noted above.   
___ CT chest (OSH)

placement with biopsy found to be squamous cell lung cancer. She 
subsequently had an ___ guided adrenal nodule biopsy. Hospital 
course complicated by multifocal pneumonia and atrial 
fibrillation with RVR.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] Will need follow up with medical oncology for squamous cell 
carcinoma of the lung- they are working on scheduling this
[ ] TTE showed new focal wall motion abnormalities- recommend 
outpt stress test as patient had ___ s/s of ACS while in the 
hospital
[ ] Pt was switched from bblocker to diltiazem for rate control 
while in the hospital.  Would consider adding back her bblocker 
as an outpt given her CHF.
[ ] ACE was held in house in the setting of normotension. Would 
try to restart as outpatient due to her HFrEF
[ ] will need f/u CT or MRI in one year for evaluation of side 
branch IPMN

# Communication: Daughters ___ (___) and 
___

# Code: DNR/DNI

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung
The patient presented with RUL collapse and mass c/f malignancy. 
Prior to admission she underwent thoracentesis on ___ which 
showed transudative pleural effusion. This admission, she 
underwent debulking and R mainstem stent placement with IP on 
___. IP procedure pathology showed squamous cell carcinoma. 
Radiation oncology was consulted who did not recommend 
palliative radiation at the time given the patient had underwent 
definitive treatment of her R mainstem obstruction with stent 
placement. She underwent further workup of her lung cancer with 
a PET-CT, which showed avid nodules in the L lung and adrenal 
gland. She had an MRI to evaluate the adrenal gland which was 
indeterminate as she was unable to hold her breath for an 
adequate study. She had a CT scan of the adrenal nodule which 
was consistent with a benign adenoma, but given the concerning 
findings on PET-CT it was not conclusive that this was a benign 
adrenal nodule. After discussion with Heme/Onc and IP, the 
adrenal nodule was biopsied by ___ without complication. 
Pathology was pending at time of discharge

# Hypoxemic respiratory failure
The patient suffered from hypoxemic respiratory failure due to 
RUL collapse secondary to obstructive mass with 95% occlusion of 
R main stem, with multifocal pneumonia also likely contributory. 
She was treated for her obstruction and pneumonia and 
respiratory status improved and she was transitioned to room 
air. On discharge, she had dyspnea with walks but ___ dyspnea at 
rest.

# Post-obstructive pneumonia
Per CT chest from OSH. She arrived from OSH on vancomycin and 
zosyn). She was narrowed to Zosyn as MRSA swab was negative. She 
was switched to ceftriaxone and metronidazole complete a 14-day 
course (___) for post-obstructive pneumonia per IP.

# Atrial fibrillation with RVR
CHADS-VASc = 4. 2D echo at CHA ___ with EF 45%, akinetic 
inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall, severely dilated LA. 
She was continued on heparin gtt I/s/o of procedures. Her atrial 
fibrillation w/ RVR was controlled with diltiazem gtt which was 
transitioned to fractionated metoprolol. However, she had poor 
control with her rates with metoprolol and so was transitioned 
to diltiazem with better control of her HR.

# ___ on CKD
Cr peaked at 1.7 at CHA from baseline 1.2-1.4, likely prerenal 
iso poor PO intake and infection. Resolved.

# Transaminitis
She had a mild transaminitis on admission which improved, alk 
phos persistently elevated.

#HFrEF (EF 45%)
Patient was found at her OSH to have a new regional wall motion 
abnormalities and inferolateral wall is akinetic with EF that 
had decreased from 60% to 45%. She was initially put on BB for 
rate control and for HFrEF but this would not maintain her rate, 
so was switched to diltiazem. She also did not have the BP room 
for ACE inhibitor. These should be restarted as an outpatient as 
tolerated.  She had ___ s/s of ACS while in the hospital.  Would 
recommend an outpt stress test to further evaluate her CAD.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with chronic systolic congestive heart failure EF 10%, 
s/p CCY ___ admitted from OSH with acute onset RUQ pain. 
Imaging with CT at OSh showed intra/extra biliary ductal 
dilation concerning or stone or mass. Also labs showed 
leukocytosis and cholestatic elevation of LFTs and given low 
grade fever, there was concern for cholangitis. He was started 
on CTx and flagyl and to ___ for ERCP. Seen by GI and 
underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone removal on ___ w/o 
complications. By next am, his AST/ALT/Tbili had improved 
considerably, he no longer had any abdominal pain, and was 
tolerating clears. For his presumed cholangitis, he was 
transitioned to unasyn on admission and eventually cipro/flagyl 
to cover for cholangitis with plan to complete 7day course. He 
was afebrile with decreasing wbc by time of discharge. 
As for his chronic sCHF, he is normally compensated and only 
takes lasix prn weight gain. He was kept off lasix and given 
gental IVFs given his NPO status. remained euvolemic. kept on 
rest of his cardiac meds including ___. For his h/o 
CAD, he had c/o extreme fatigue day PTA so he was ruled out with 
EKG and trops. he was kept on his statin/gemfib (LFTs better) 
and ___. On ASA 81 at ___, but this should not be started 
for another 36hours after discharge. 
For his DM, he had recieved contrast at OSH and was NPO, so kept 
on humalog SSI instead of his oral regimen of 
metformin/glyburide. These were resumed on d/c. 
Overall he did very well. He will f/u with Dr. ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o female with h.o asthma, afib on coumadin, who presented 
with fatigue, weakness, dyspnea and cough, was found to have 
extensive wheezing c/w an acute asthma exacerbation in the 
setting of a probable viral infection.  
.  
.  
#Viral bronchitis with acute asthma exacerbation-
Pt reports a h.o asthma and CHF. However, her clinical history 
of sore throat, cough and generalized weakness was suggestive of 
an infectious process. She reported T to 100 at home, but was 
afebrile without a leukocytosis throughout her hospitalization. 
CXR final read was negative for pneumonia.
She was initially treated with Levofloxacin, albuterol, 
atrovent, and steroids.  There was initially some concern that 
the patient may have an underlying pneumonia, however after 
further evaluation, this was thought less likely, and 
antibiotics were discontinued.  She was treated with scheduled 
albuterol/Ipratropium nebulizers with symptomatic benefit.  As 
she continued to improve, the frequency was decreased, and later 
changed to a scheduled Combivent MDI.  Her prednisone was 
started at 60 mg, however this was rapidly tapered down to 20 mg 
(and levofloxacin was discontinued), when she began to develop 
bilateral calf pain with ambulation that was concerning for an 
___ tendinopathy.  She was continued on her home accolate. 
 
Her BNP was elevated on admission, but her presentation was not 
thought represent acute CHF given her euvolmic appearance. 
Additionally, she was trialed with a single dose of IV lasix, 
which did not improve her respiratory status, but did cause a 
slight elevation in her BUN/Cr.
At the time of discharge, she was satting approx 94% on room 
air, but she required 2 L NC with ambulation for desaturations 
to 85%.  Her lung exam at discharge is notable for diffuse 
wheezing, with fair to good air exchange; this is significantly 
improved from admission.
Please note that the patient is on Advair BID at home. This is 
currently being held due to the acute exacerbation, but it 
should be resumed once the acute flare has resolved.
.  
#history of CHF-unknown EF. 
Pt has a known history of CHF, and she was recently hospitalized 
for a CHF exacerbation at another hospital prior to admission. 
She did not appear to be in CHF during this admission, despite 
an elevated BNP on admission. She was trialed with a single dose 
of IV lasix during the admission, which resulted in a slight 
increase in her BUN/Cr, suggesting that she is not volume 
overloaded.  She was continued on her home dose of lasix.
.  
# ___ tendonitis  
Pt was noted to develop bilat calf pain with ambulation with ___ 
on ___. ___ was negative for DVT. Pt is slightly tender to 
palpation at area of insertion of tendon to calf muscle. Pt at 
risk for ___ tendonitis given age, steroids, and 
levofloxacin.  Levofloxacin was immediately discontinued, and 
prednisone was rapidly tapered.  Pt's activity was restricted to 
levels that minimized calf discomfort, to minimize the strain 
and risk for tendon rupture.  At the time of discharge, pt 
reports that the pain has been improving, and is only rated as 
""very mild"".

History of Present Illness:
___ y/o M w PMH CAD s/p PCI with stent (___), CABGx4 (___), 
chronic CHF, HLD, HTN, T2DM, benign bladder tumor, prostate CA 
s/p TURP and radiation, presented to ___ with 
tachycardia and midsternal CP, ""pressure and burning"" x1 day, 
was tachycardic to high 120s despite Metoprolol 5mg IV x3, went 
to Cath lab (concern for STEMI), cath c/b difficulty crossing 
the Cx, no culprit lesion identified, transferred to ___ for 
further monitoring and in case of high risk PCI, AiBP. 

During the cath with Dr. ___, attempts at crossing the Cx with 
ChoICE ___ XS and Pilot 50 wires were made. It was determined 
that intervention on the ostial Cx and LMCA would be required, 
which would be of significant risk at ___. Pt was 
bolused with 2000u Heparin and loaded with Ticagrelor 180 mg. R 
femoral artery approach, angiosealed. Of note, pt had 
tachyarrhythmia read as Afib, during cath was Amio bolused, 
started on drip, and converted to sinus rhythm during the 
procedure but was maintained on the drip until arrival at ___.

EKG: HR 124, Aflutter/AT, STE III, aVR, V1; STD I, aVL, V2-6.
Labs/studies notable for: Troponin I 0.79 (ref range 
0.00-0.029), BUN 26, Cr 1.5, H/H 12.5/39.5
Patient was given: Amiodarone 150 and started on gtt, Ticagrelor 
180

On arrival to the CCU:  Comfortable, CP-free, no difficulty 
breathing. Pt states he recently stopped using a walker, which 
he had been using for a year, had increased physical activity in 
the past week, came back from a walk on afternoon prior to 
presentation, felt tired, tried to nap, couldn't get 
comfortable, felt chest discomfort. Took BP 3x, which was 
elevated (over baseline of 110s-120s) to 140s, HR was 
persistently in 120s, so he called EMS. Had been told at prior 
appointment with cardiology NP that he might have an irregular 
rhythm on exam but no EKG was done. Had a pre-op EKG done in the 
past week, was not told it was abnormal.

IMAGING/PROCEDURES:
ECHO ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial 
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal 
echocardiography). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near 
akinesis of the basal ___ of the inferior and inferolateral 
walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 
%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction most 
c/w CAD (PDA distribution). Mild mitral regurgitation.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p PCI with stent (___), CABGx4 
(___), chronic CHF, HLD, HTN, T2DM, benign bladder tumor, 
prostate CA s/p TURP and radiation, presenting to ___ with 
tachyarrhythmia, likely Aflutter vs AT, and CP, cath with no 
intervention, transferred to ___ for potential high-risk PCI.

# ACS/STEMI, diffuse disease, culprit lesion likely LCx, 80% 
stenosis of LMCA into bypassed LAD, LAD heavily diseased and 
occluded after a large bifurcating D1 in the proximal portion, 
RCA graft occluded. No definitive culprit lesion identified, EKG 
with STE in aVR and V1 with STD in II and III, possibly 
representative of global ischemia, could be demand ischemia with 
mild bump in Troponin I to 0.79 at OSH, MB unknown. He was given 
Aspirin 81mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, and Ticagrelor 90mg 
twice daily after loading with 180mg. His cardiac enzymes were 
trended, CKMB peaked at 89 and Trop-T peaked at 2.84. He was 
started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation. He was also 
started on metoprolol, which was up-titrated as his blood 
pressure tolerated. Lisinopril was started when his creatinine 
returned to baseline. He was initially made NPO for possible 
cardiac cath, but given that it would be a high risk PCI, this 
was deferred until the outpatient setting, likely after his 
a-flutter had been properly rhythm controlled. His Ticagrelor 
was switched to Plavix given his need for anticoagulation (see 
below). An Echo was obtained to assess for focal wall motion 
abnormalities (see results above).

# New Afib reported, however review of records suggests more 
likely Aflutter vs ATach, likely causing demand ischemia leading 
to chest discomfort and EKG changes in light of the cath which 
showed no active thrombus. He was initially anticoagulated with 
heparin, then bridged to warfarin. He underwent TEE and 
cardioversion on ___ with return to sinus rhythm. He was 
subsequently loaded with Amiodarone. He was noted to return to A 
flutter on ___. Metoprolol was initiated for rate control and 
he was discharged on therapeutic anticoagulation with 
instructions to follow up as an outpatient for possible repeat 
DCCV.

# ___ with unknown baseline. His creatinine was monitored 
closely while he recovered from his initial cardiac insult. His 
Cr returned to apparent baseline of 1.4 prior to discharge.

# Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Pt recently underwent 
biopsy of throat; biopsy returned during this admission positive 
for cancer. Dr. ___ ENT) communicated this to pt 
via cell phone. Per ___ records: pathology - left true vocal cord 
with SCC, keratinizing. Focal reactivity for p16. Plan for CT 
neck at ___ per surgery notes once d/c from hospital.

CHRONIC ISSUES
=================
# chronic CHF, unknown status, not currently on home diuretic 
but weighs himself daily. He did not require diuresis during 
admission.

# CAD s/p PCI and CABGx4, with po LMCA had 80% stenosis into the 
bypassed LAD. He was continued on home Asa 81, Rosuvastatin 
[Crestor] 40 mg PO QPM, and Lisinopril [Zestril Tab] 2.5 mg, 
titrated up to 10mg at time of discharge.

# Anemia, likely from chronic disease, h/o hematuria. He was 
continued on iron supplementation and discharged home with 
stable H&H.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You came to ___ from another hospital. There, you were having 
chest pain and underwent a cardiac catheterization. You were 
found to have blockages that were difficult to fix and 
transferred to ___ for further care.

Here, you were noticed to have very fast and irregular heart 
rates (Atrial Fibrillation). For the fast heart rate, we 
attempted to shock (cardiovert) your heart into a normal rhythm. 
Your heart went back to an irregular rhythm, so we treated you 
with medications to slow the heart rate down.

The fast and irregular heart rate also made fluid back up in 
your lungs, called heart failure. You received medications to 
help you get back into balance.

The irregular heart rate (atrial fibrillation) puts you at risk 
for developing blood clots and having a stroke. To reduce this 
risk, we treated you with a medication called Coumadin (generic: 
warfarin). This medication increases your risk of bleeding. You 
need to have regular blood draws to check your clotting levels 
while we get to a stable Coumadin dose. You can have these labs 
checked by the ___.

You should follow-up with your ___ doctors about the ___ 
results and treatment. Please also follow up with Dr. ___ 
(___) in 1 month for a repeat cardiac catheterization and 
possible cardioversion.

All of your conditions are stable and you are safe to go home, 
with follow-up at the ___.

We wish you the best!
Your ___ Team

failure exacerbation. Patient symptoms improved with diuresis 
and patient was without shortness of breath or dyspnea on 
exertion at discharge.   

=====================
ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES
===================== 

# Acute on Chronic ___: Patient presented with dyspnea on 
exertion, orthopnea, BNP 1422, and improvement in symptoms after 
Lasix diuresis consistent with heart failure exacerbation. TTE 
showed preserved EF >55% which was unchanged from prior. Of note 
patient had not taken lasix in ___ year. Possibly contributing 
factors are Afib, lasix non compliance, HTN, undiagnosed OSA. 
Patient responded well to 40mg IV lasix, transitioned to 60mg PO 
lasix daily on discharge with potassium supplementation 20mEq PO 
daily. He did not have shortness of breath at rest or with 
exertion on discharge. He will follow up with PCP ___ 
Dr. ___ in cardiology.  

# pAfib: Patient found to be in Afib w/RVR in ED, but 
asymptomatic during episode. Patient had missed home dose of 
metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO BID. CHADS2 of 2. Chronically 
anticoagulated with warfarin with therapeutic INR 2.4. Afib with 
RVR most likely secondary to missing dose of home medication as 
well as volume overload with atrial stretch. Patient continued 
on home metoprolol tartrate 75mg PO BID with return to normal 
sinus rhythm with heart rates in the ___ on discharge. Patient 
transitioned to metoprolol succinate 150mg PO daily prior to 
discharge and continued on home coumadin 6mg PO daily. Patient 
will follow up with PCP, ___, and outpatient 
cardiology. 

#Viral URI: Patient with productive cough, rhinorrhea, and 
congestion. No fever, leukocytosis, or infiltrate on initial CXR 
to suggest bacterial etiology. Patient started on flonase nasal 
spray 1 spray each nostril daily with improvement in symptoms. 
Patient to continue flonase for 1 week at discharge. 
 

======================
CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES
======================
# CAD: No evidence of ischemia based on no ischemic changes on 
EKG, negative troponin, and no focal wall motion abnormalities 
on TTE. Continued patient's home simvastatin, aspirin, and beta 
blocker adjusted as above.

# Hypertension: SBP currently well-controlled during this 
admission, adjusted home metoprolol as above, no need or further

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent 
admission to the ___. You came 
into the hospital because of cough and shortness of breath. We 
found that you had a fast heart rate as well as extra fluid in 
your legs and in your lungs from a heart failure exacerbation. 
An ultrasound of your heart showed that it is pumping with 
normal function but doesnt fill as well as normal. We treated 
your heart failure with a ""water pill"" called lasix. You will 
continue to take this medication, 60mg, daily. You will also 
need to take potassium supplementation (20mEq) daily as the 
water pill can cause your potassium to be low.

Please weigh yourself everyday and call your doctor if your 
weight goes up by 3 pounds or more.

We treated your heart rate with your home medication metoprolol 
and switched to a long acting form so you will take 1 of the new 
pill daily to control your heart rate.  Please follow up with 
your outpatient primary care physician and cardiologist as 
detailed below.

We also have treated you for a viral upper respiratory tract 
infection with a nasal steroid. 

If you should develop chest pain, palpitations, shortness of 
breath, fever, chills, lightheadedness please call your primary 
care physician or report to the emergency department.

Be well and take care.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Care Team

atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No ___ clot, mild to moderate SEC seen with low 
velocities. Normal LV and RV function.

___ TTE: 
The left atrium is dilated. There is symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Limited study. Small, hypertrophied left ventricle 
with vigorous systolic function. No clinically-significant 
valvular disease seen.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable 
for review) of ___, the findings are similar.  

___ CXR: 
As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is 
seen. 
The patient is slightly rotated to the left, causing increased 
radiodensity of the left lower hemithorax.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly and signs of mild fluid overload persist.  No 
larger pleural effusions.  No pneumonia.

AMS and fatigue, meets SIRS criteria, also found to be in AFib 
w/RVR.

ACUTE ISSUES: 
=========
# Sepsis: patient met ___ SIRS criteria on presentation (HR > 
90, WBC > 12K), later tachypneic. Given complaint of cough, 
sources may include pneumonia or worsening of her chronic sinus 
infection. For the latter, she was seen by ENT on ___, and they 
believed that she had been undertreated. She had been placed on 
a 21d course of Augmentin, with prednisone taper (which per ___ 
records appears to have been completed, as this is not an active 
medication for her), Prilosec and NeilMed nasal saline 
irrigations. UA was not convincing for infection. Patient is ___ 
resident. Here started on broad coverage for HCAP/aspiration PNA 
with Vanc/Zosyn/Levaquin but vanc/zosyn were discontinued upon 
further improvement and pt was continued on levaquin x5 days 
(completed course on ___. 

# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Rate control attempted with dilt 
pushes in the ED, placed on dilt gtt before being brought to the 
CCU. Here, dilt gtt held and was given IV metoprolol 10mg x1 
with reduction in HR from 140s-150s to 120s. Because ED did 
claim initial success with diltiazem, will attempt two-agent 
rate control o/n. No clear etiology for new-onset AFib, most 
likely response to sepsis, TSH nl. No known cardiac disease or 
valvular abnormalities. Unclear etiology for ___ stroke, may 
have had pAF previously undiagnosed (causing stroke then). 
Started on heparin drip with bridge to coumadin. She underwent 
TEE with cardioversion on ___, which was successful and pt 
reverted to sinus rhythm with HR 55-60. Nodal blocking agents 
were downtrended on discharge: metoprolol XL 200mg daily. 
Diltiazem was discontinued. Amiodorane was started at 400mg tid 
starting Amiodarone x 3 days (___), followed by 400 BID x 1 
week, 400 daily x 1 week followed by 200 mg daily indefinately. 

# Respiratory Distress: On BiPap in ED with concern for 
pulmonary edema radiologically and by clinical exam. ___ have 
developed transient pulmonary edema from AFib w/RVR. Taken off 
BiPAP on arrival to ICU, and placed on NC O2. Diuresed with 
improvement. Also has history of COPD, continued home 
fluticasone, tiotroprium, added ipratroprium/albuterol prn. 

# AMS: Delirious overnight, but still orientable to answer 
questions, talk about home activities, gives her name. Has 
dementia at baseline (on donepazil), likely exacerbated by 
sepsis and acute hospitalization.
- Continue seizures medications (see below)
- Continue dementia and depression medications (see below)
- Hold sedating medications
- Frequent re-orientation
- ___ protocol 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===========
# Chronic Sinusitis: Transitioned from home augmentin to zosyn 
while covering for HCAP. Continued saline nasal spray. 
Transitioned back to augmentin... 

# Diabetes: On glargine 35u qHS and novolin 10u TID at home. 
Here, placed on glargine 35 U qHS and ISS.

# Dementia: Continued home donepazil.

# Depression: Continued home duloxetine. 

# Seizure D/O: Continued home phenytoin and leVETiracetam.

# Migraines: Excedrin PRN.

# HLD: Continued home simvastatin.

# GERD: Continued home omeprazole.

# h/o C. diff: On vanc capsule daily at home. Placed on liquid 
vancomycin while here.

# Constipation: Continued home polyethylene glycol, docusate, 
senna

# Vitamins: Continued Vit B12, Vit D, Ca, Fe, MTV.

TTE (___):
Conclusions  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild global left 
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50%), although this may be a 
slight underestimation in the setting of frequent ventricular 
ectopy. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus 
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with mild global systolic dysfunction. 
Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitatin. Moderate pulmonary 
hypertension. Frequent ventricular ectopy.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: Patient is an ___ yo male 
with PMH of CAD, afib, MVR, prostate cancer with suprapubic 
catheter, and COPD who presents from home with rigors and 
weakness. ___ was being treated for UTI and possible pneumonia as 
well and discharged with a home course of antibiotics to 
___ with PCP.
.
ACUTE CARE: 
1. Urinary tract infection: Patient developed altered mental 
status suddenly on the afternoon of admission after what is 
described to be rigors. ___ was symptomatic with suprapubic 
tenderness, weakness, and inability to communicate. His 
neurologic exam, as much as ___ was able to cooperate at the time 
is nonfocal. His catheter was changed, and with antibiotics 
ovenight his mental status improved and ___ was transferred from 
the ICU to medical floor. ___ again transiently spiked a fever on 
transfer to the floor but remained mentating well and then 
defervesced. ___ had a positive UA and a UC which grew mixed 
flora. ___ received antibiotic treatment with great improvement 
and was discharged home on a course of levofloxacin.
.
2. Hypoxia: Patient developed new oxygen requirement on 
transition to floor from the ICU. CXR showed vascular 
congestion. His home lasix which was temporarily held was 
restarted, patient had excellent urine output and his hypoxia 
improved. ___ was discharged on home lasix and satting well on 
room air.
. 
3. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure: On transfer to the floor from 
MICU, patient's chest exam revealed rapid onset rales and his 
oxygen saturation dropped from 98%RA to 94%RA. CXR revealed 
increased left pleural effusion and increased pulmonary vascular 
congestion. With resuming lasix therapy, patient had a 
successful diuresis and his oxygenation improved to no oxygen 
requirement. Echo revealed normal EF, showing this was likely an 
episode of acute diastolic heart failure.
.
4. Delirium: On presentation, patient was only responsive to 
questioning with grunts while his baseline mental status is 
A+Ox3 and capable of organizing club activities with groups at 
his living facility. This was likely secondary to infectious 
process on top of underlying mild chronic cerebral vascular 
disease. The altered mental status resolved with IV antibiotics 
and patient returned to his baseline mental status with 
treatment of UTI.  
. 
CHRONIC CARE: 
1. CAD w/ history of stent: Patient presented off of ASA given 
anemia secondary to GIB. ___ was continued on his home 
antihypertensives.
.
2. Mitral Valve Pathology: ___ echo showed moderate MR. ___ 
CHF is not in patient's PMH, ___ does report a history swollen 
ankles and does require home lasix suggesting predilection to 
CHF. Repeat echo showed normal EF and mild MR. ___ was discharged 
to PCP ___.
.  
3. H/o TIA's: Patient's coumadin was initially held for 
supratherapeutic INR but was restarted at discharge to be 
followed-up by his ___ clinic.
.  
4. Afib s/p MAZE: Patient was rate controlled with AV pacing at 
60, and is on warfarin anticoagulation.  
.  
5. Asthma: Continued home inhalers.  
.  
6. Prostate ca: Continued Leupron.  
.  
7. GERD: Continued PPI 
.  
8. Constipation: Patient received bisacodyl suppository  
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care. You were admitted to 
the hospital because you had sudden onset weakness and chills 
and we found that you had a urinary tract infection. You also 
had shortness of breath which may have been from a pneumonia.  
You were treated with antibiotics and have had much improvement. 
You were discharged home to complete a course of antibiotics and 
will follow up with your primary care physician (we have made 
appointments for you - please see below).

You also were found to have a large amount of stool on your CT 
scan so we recommend that you take the stool softeners to ensure 
you have a bowel movement once a day.

You also were found to have an elevated INR from your coumadin 
so we held this while you were here.  Today we restarted it 
because your INR was too low. Please have your doctors ___ 
your ___ at your follow up visit tomorrow.

Please make the following changes to your medications:
START** Levofloxacin antibiotics 250 mg once a day for 7 more 
days (to end ___
START** Senna 1 tablet twice a day as needed for constipation
START** Colace 1 tablet twice a day as needed for constipation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ACLS for pulselessness
 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with h/o HIV on HAART (CD4 1049) and recent 
L5-S1 fusion 3 weeks ago who presents with hypotension and 
seizures.
.
She was admitted ___ to ___ for L5-S1 fusion that was 
uncomplicated.  She was not discharged on DVT prophylaxis given 
the surgery.  She was at rehab until about 1 week ago.  This 
morning, she complained of palpitations as well as leg pain 
which was new.  Then her physical therapist noted a low BP 
(unclear reading) and felt that she may be dehydrated.  She also 
complained of chest pain.  Later, her ___ noted low BP as well.  
Her daughter then witnessed a tonic-clonic seizure where the 
patient fell back on the bed and her eyes rolled back in her 
head and her extremities were shaking.  She has never had 
seizures prior.  EMS was called.  BP on arrival by EMS was 
60/palp which improved to 74/palp after 500cc IVF.

In the ED, she was hypotensive and initially given aspirin and 
morphine.  CTA showed massive saddle PE.  She was hypotensive 
with SBP in the 30___s and was intubated and started on peripheral 
levophed.  Also given 6L fluid.  TPA was then initiated at 21:39 
(100mg IV over 20 minutes).  Sedated with versed and fentanyl.  
Phenylephrine was started when she maxed out on levophed.  SBP 
decreased to the 50's and she lost a pulse and chest 
compressions were started, 1mg epi given, pulse returned after 1 
minute.  Cardiology was consulted but declined to take her to 
the cath lab.  Her BP's began to improve and SBP was 170's and 
pressors were weaned.  Currently SBP in the 90's on 
neosynephrine only, HR 90's (previously 140-150).  Thoracic 
surgery also aware and discussing patient's case.  She then 
received 5000unit heparin bolus plus started on heparin drip at 
1000 units/hr.

IMAGING:
CTA: 
FINDINGS: 
There is adequate opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree. 
The main 
pulmonary artery is enlarged, measuring up to 3.0 cm, and there 
are extensive pulmonary emboli, including a large saddle embolus 
and additional emboli extending into both the right and left 
main pulmonary arteries and peripheral pulmonary arterial tree. 
There is no associated pulmonary infarct. However, there is 
evidence of right heart strain, including dilation of the right 
atrium and right ventricle, leftwardbowing of the 
interventricular septum, and reflux of contrast into the IVC and 
hepatic veins. The aorta is normal. There is no evidence of 
acute aortic syndrome. There is no mediastinal or hilar 
lymphadenopathy. There is no pericardial effusion or pleural 
effusion.  There is atelectasis medially at the right lung base. 
There is no evidence of pneumonia. There is no pulmonary nodule 
or mass identified.  In the included upper abdomen, there is a 
single hypodensity within the left lobe of the liver, too small 
to characterize, though likely a cyst. There is no acute 
intra-abdominal process identified.   
BONE WINDOWS: There are no lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions 
identified 
concerning for malignancy.   
IMPRESSION:  
1. Massive saddle pulmonary emboli, extending into both the 
right and left 
main pulmonary arteries and all aspects of the pulmonary 
arterial tree.    
2. Evidence of right heart strain, including dilation of the 
right atrium and right ventricle and bowing of the 
interventricular septum. Prominent main PA suggest associated 
pulmonary hypertension. 
3. Minor right basilar atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary 
infarct. 
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right 
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free 
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position 
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe 
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at 
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with severe systolic 
dysfunction. Severe functional tricuspid regurgitation. At least 
moderate pulmonary hypertension. Small, hypertrophied left 
ventricle with preserved global and regional systolic function.  

.
CXR: FINDINGS: Right lower lung atelectasis and minimal right 
pleural effusion are no different from prior radiograph dated 
___. Mild vascular engorgement is similar to the 
prior radiograph. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Mediastinal 
and hilar contours are unchanged. No new lung opacities of 
concern. Left PICC line terminates at upper SVC. 
IMPRESSION: Since ___, the right minimal pleural 
effusion and lower lung atelectasis are unchanged. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
*Anticipated stay at rehab facility is less than 30 days.*
.
___ year old female with h/o HIV on HAART (CD4 1049) and recent 
L5-S1 fusion 3 weeks prior to admission who presented with 
hypotension and experienced cardiac arrest while in the ED, 
found to have massive PE.
.
# Massive PE with hypotension/shock: PE occurred in post-op 
setting. Received TPA in the ED with some improvement in 
hemodynamics but then became pulseless. She was coded in the ED 
with return of pulse. She was initially on pressors but was then 
able to be weaned off in the MICU.  Also had some demand 
ischemia with elevated cardiac enzymes that trended down 
afterwards. TTE showed global RV dilation/disfunction and severe 
TR w/ preserved LVEF. She was initially treated with IV heparin 
and was starting to be bridged to warfarin therapy. Prior to 
discharge, the heparin drip was discontinued, and the patient 
was started on Lovenox ___ subcuntaneously every 12 hours 
daily. The Lovenox was discontinued when her INR was 
therapeutic. She was discharged on warfarin 3mg orally daily. 
Her INR on day of discharge was 2.4. She will need to be set up 
with ___ clinic as an outpatient for INR monitoring. 
.  
# Hypoxia/Tachypnea: Patient successfully extubated ___ and 
upon arrival to the medicine floor was tachypnic breathing in 
the high ___, low ___ with 3 liters of supplemental oxygen. She 
remained stable, and on day of discharge, the oxygen was weaned 
with a respiratory rate in the ___. 
.
#Altered Mental Status: There was concern during the admission 
on the medicine floor that the patient had acutely developed 
altered mental status. Her neurological exam was non-focal and 
consistent with her exam on presentation to the medicine floor. 
Despite being afebrile without a leukocytosis, an infectios 
work-up was repeated. So far, this work-up has returned 
negative.   
.
# Anemia: Hct had trended down from 29 on admission to 25 at 
present. An active type and screen was maintained through the 
entire admission. She required no trasnfusions. She remains 
hemodynamically stable, with no evidence of active bleeding at 
present. She did have some mild oozing from OGT while in ICU, 
and she was started on ranitidine out of concern for GI bleed. 
Propton pump inhibitor was contraindicated given the iteraction 
with nelfinavir (part of HARRT regimen). 
.  
# Transaminitis: During the admission, AST as high as 2000s and 
ALT in 700s. While the patient does have h/o HBV and HCV, acute 
rise was likely secondary to shock liver versus hepatic 
congestion in setting of severe RV failure. His LFTs were 
trended through the admission and steadily fell during the 
admission. 
.  
# Elevated troponin: Trop peaked at 1.11 and has since trended 
down.  
Elevation was in setting of massive PE, shock, right heart 
strain and delivery of chest compressions. TTE showed dilated RV 
with severe systolic dysfunction. MB remained flat. 
.
#Idioventricular rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry 
through her admission. She remained mostly in sinus rhythm 
during her hospitalization, but she was noted to have times of 
broad QRS complexes without preceding P waves. These telemetry 
findings were confirmed on EKG. Cardiac enzymes were cycled and 
were flat. Cardiology was consulted and felt her rhythm was from 
an irritable focus secondary to her ventricular remodeling in 
the presence of her massive pulmonary embolism.  Cardiology 
recommended that the patient's metoprolol be stopped. Her 
metoprolol was discontinued.
.  
# Complicated Urinary Tract Infection: Patient with fever of 
100.4 on day prior to admission to the medicine floor. Through 
her admission on the medicine floor, the patient remained 
afebrile. Fever may be secondary to PE, liver dysfunction. No 
clear source of infection, as no consolidation on recent CXR; 
blood cultures remain negative to date. No leukocytosis. On day 
of discharge, the patient's urine culture returned showing 
enterococcus in the urine susceptible to ampicillin, macrobid,

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at ___. You were hospitalized 
because of a massive Pulmonary Embolism (a large blood clot in 
your lungs).  This blood clot likely came after your surgery, 
and formed in your legs then traveled to your lungs.  You were 
given medications to thin your blood, and will continue 
treatment for at least 6 more months.
.
You have been started on a medication called warfarin (AKA 
Coumadin).  This medication thins your blood.  The effects of 
this medication are checked with a blood test called the 
international normalized ratio (AKA INR).  Your INR is a number 
that reflects the ""thinness"" of your blood, and the goal INR for 
your treatment is between ___.  Your INR will need to be checked 
frequently in the beginning of your treatment ___ times a 
week), and will gradually be checked less ___ times a month) as 
your medical team helps adjust your medication to keep your INR 
between ___.  You should anticipate occassional warfarin dose 
adjustments (maybe more in the beginning), in order to keep your 
INR in the ___ range.  Warfarin metabolism is affected by the 
foods you eat, specifically leafy green vegetables.  You can eat 
the same foods you usually eat, but avoid drastically changing 
your diet and speak with your physician before changing your 
diet as your warfarin dose may need to be adjusted.  While on 
warfarin, you are at increased risk of bleeding.  If you notice 
severe bleeding, including rectal bleeds, bleeding from the 
urethra, or nosebleeds, contact your physician.  It is important 
that if you suffer a fall or traumatic injury while taking 
warfarin that you call your doctor or report to the emergency 
room for evaluation to make sure you are not bleeding 
internally.
.
Please take all medications as instructed. Please note the 
following medication changes:
*NEW:
-Warfarin 3mg orally daily (oral blood thinning medication; note 
that the dose may have to be changed)
-nystatin  100,000 unit/mL Suspension  Sig:  Five (5) ML orally 
4 times a day for thrush for 10 days.     
-ranitidine 150 mg oral daily (acid suppression medication)
-Senna 8.6 mg tablets 2x a day as needed for constipation 
(stimulant laxative)
-Colace 100 mg capsule 2x a day (stool softener)
-Methyl salicylate-menthol oitnment apply topically as needed 
for pain
-Nitrofurantoin 100mg orally twice daily for 14 days
-Tramadol 50mg ___ pills every 6 hours as needed for pain.
.
*CHANGED:
-Increase your dose of lisinopril from 2.5mg to 10mg by mouth 
daily.
-Decreased the dose of your potassium chloride pill to 10mEq (1 
tab) per day.
.
*STOPPED: Stopped home Percocet.  Please stop your home 
metoprolol as well. 
.
Please arrange with your rehab facility making a hospital 
follow-up appointment with your primary care physician ___ 2 
weeks of discharge. You will need to be followed the ___ 
clinic for monitoring of your blood INR while you are on 
Coumadin (also known as warfarin)

*Anticipated stay at rehab is less than 30 days.*

MICROBIOLOGY:
==============
___: Urine cultures - NEG
___:  blood cultures - NEG

IMAGING:
=========
CXR (___):
FINDINGS:    
There is moderate, diffuse interstitial abnormality consistent 
with pulmonary edema. There is no large pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. No mediastinal or hilar 
abnormality. Osseous structures are demineralized, however 
grossly intact.   
IMPRESSION:    
Moderate pulmonary edema without large pleural effusions. In the 
appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia could have a similar 
appearance. 

TTE (___):
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is 
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
hypokinesis of the mid to distal septum, and inferior wall, the 
distal anterior wall and apex, and the entire inferolateral 
wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %). 
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be 
underestimated. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a prominent fat pad. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction suggestive of multivessel CAD. 
Severe mitral regurgitation. At least mild to moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Cardiac Catheterization ___
Dominance: Right
LMCA: heavily calcified; ostial 90% eccentric LMCA stenosis.
LAD: heavily calcified; 50% mid LAD stenosis. There were robust 
septal
collaterals to the distal RCA.
LCX: heavily calcified; AV groove CX was subtotal or totally 
occluded after OM1. The CX appeared occluded again after the 
branching OM2. There was likely another occlusion in the 
proximal portion of OM2.
RCA: heavily calcified; proximal 50% stenosis at the high ___ RV 
branch. The mid RCA had serial 80% stenoses prior to a mid 
vessel recanalized total occlusion. The distal RCA and the RPDA 
filled via left-to-right and RV/AM collaterals. The RPDA was 
fractionated when filled via right-to-right collaterals, 
consistent with serial high grade lesions.

Chest CT ___
1. Moderate calcification of the aortic annulus and mild 
calcification of the aortic valve. 
2. Moderate bilateral left greater than right non hemorrhagic 
pleural 
effusions with almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe. 
3. Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the coronary 
arteries, great vessels, and major branches of the abdominal 
aorta. 
4. Moderate emphysema. 
5. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 1.1 cm in the 
prevascular 
station, nonspecific. 

Head CT ___
1. Slightly prominent hyperdense nodule identified in the left 
parotid gland, partially evaluated in this exam, correlation 
with parotid gland ultrasound is recommended, probably 
consistent with an intraparotid lymph node, however other 
entities cannot be completely excluded. 
2. No acute intracranial process such as infarction or 
hemorrhage. 
3. Periventricular white matter hypodensities left greater than 
right are 
nonspecific but suggest small vessel ischemic disease. 
4. Bilateral V4 vertebral artery atherosclerotic calcifications. 

  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Slightly hyperdense nodule in the left 
parotid gland as described above, partially evaluated in this 
exam, correlation with parotid gland ultrasound is recommended. 

Carotid Ultrasound ___
1.  Moderate heterogeneous plaque involving the left internal 
carotid artery with resultant elevated velocities (up to 215 
centimeters/second) and 60-69% stenosis. 
2.  Antegrade left vertebral flow.  The right vertebral artery 
was not 
visualized. 

Transesophageal Echocardiogram, Intraoperative ___
Conclusions   
PRE-BYPASS: 
The left atrium is dilated. A left-to-right shunt is present 
across the interatrial septum at rest (PFO). Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
top normal/borderline dilated. There is mild-to-moderate 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 35-40%) with 
hypokinesis of the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral 
walls. The right ventricular cavity is within normal limits with 
normal free wall function. There are simple atheroma in the 
aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending 
thoracic aorta. There is a IABP seen in the descending aorta 
approximately 9 cm distal to the subclavian artery. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Moderate to severe (3+) central mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is mild (1+) tricuspid regurgitation. There is a small 
left pleural effusion and perihepatic fluid visualized. 

POST Bypass: 
The patient is in an atrially-paced rhythm and receiving a 
phenylephrine infusion. An epinephrine infusion (0.03 
mcg/kg/min) is initiated over the course of the post-bypass 
exam.
Left ventricular function is reduced compared to pre-bypass, 
with an estimated EF of ___. The inferior wall is now 
dyskinetic. The anterior and anterolateral walls appear mildly 
hypokinetic compared to pre-bypass.
Right ventricular function remains preserved.
There is an annuloplasty ring in the mitral position. There is 
mild residual mitral regurgitation. Peak gradient across the 
valve is 6 mmHg; mean gradient is 2 mmHg.
The IABP remains approximately 9 cm distal to the left 
subclavian artery.
The left pleural effusion is no longer present.
The aorta is intact after decannulation.
.
PA/LAT CXR ___:
In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and 
support devices have been removed except for the right IJ 
catheter.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Indistinctness of 
pulmonary vessels again suggests elevated pulmonary venous 
pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with 
substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Small bilateral 
pleural effusions. 
.
HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST ___:  
1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or large vascular 
territory 
infarction. 
2. No evidence of fracture. 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a past medical history of 
CAD s/p prior NSTEMIs, GI bleeding/AVMs, and recent SAH who was 
admitted for  ___ yo F PMH with h/o SAH, CAD c/b NSTEMI, HTN, DM2, 
GI bleeding/AVMs, initially presented to CHA complaining of body 
aches, especially under the breast radiating to the mouth and 
jaw. She had nausea with 2 episodes of dry heaves. She has also 
had a dry cough and increased urinary frequency for several 
days. 

MICU Course (___)

# Hypotension:
# Leukocytosis: With WBC elevation, c/f septic shock, with most 
likely sources urine (UA abnormal and pt with urinary frequency) 
vs Pulmonary (cough, hypoxia, wheezes on exam). With recent 
hospital admissions will treat with broad spectrum ABX for UTI 
and HCAP. Differential also includes cardiogenic as patient pw 
ST depressions and elevated trop with relatively cool (though 
not cold) extremities on exam; as well as GI bleed though not 
having increased stool output and stool is dark brown, likely 
does not explain her level of hypotension. Given IV vancomycin 
and cefepime (day ___. In the morning with rising troponin 
and TTE that shows severe mitral regurgitation hypotension most 
likely a cardiac cause.

# NSTEMI type 1 vs type 2: In setting of hypotension/anemia was 
initially thought to be most likely demand ischemia, however as 
above cannot definitively rule out ACS with cardiogenic shock. 
In the ED, she was given full dose ASA and admitted to ICU. TIMI 
score 4. EKGs with dynamic changes notable for elevation in AVR 
and diffuse depressions most prominently across V2-V6. She had a 
recent TTE from OSH about 1 month prior to admission, which 
showed mild MR with some possible ___ but overall preserved 
LVEF. Patient was started on arrival to the MICU with heparin 
gtt per recommendations from cardiology. She was also given 
atorvastatin 80mg PO daily. TTE this admission was concerning 
for ischemic changes given worsening MR and more notable ___ and 
LVEF of 35%. As such, patient was transferred to the CCU team 
after urgent cardiac catheterization, which showed severe ostial 
LMCA and 3 vessel coronary artery disease with chronic total 
occlusions of the RCA and LCX. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Mild 
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate elevation of 
PCW after diuresis for clinically diagnosed diastolic heart 
failure in the setting of acutely diagnosed systolic heart 
failure. Successful insertion of 8 ___ 30 cc IABP via the 
right femoral artery given high risk CAD.

# Anemia: 
# possible GI bleed: Patient received 2 units of pRBCs. Trending 
was Patient s/p 2U pRBCs. Had home-occult positive rectal exam 
by GI. Patient was placed on IV PPI BID. The GI team was 
following along the patients course. CBC was followed and it 
increased post transfusion from 6.8 at OSH to 9.6.

# ___: Baseline 1.5, was 2.0 earlier in the day at CHA down to 
1.8 at ___ after IVF. Elevated Cr and granular casts c/f 
pre-renal ___, in the setting hypotension. Improving and close 
to baseline. 

# Transaminitis: C/f shock liver as LFTs were WNL in ED at 
___ just this afternoon, and now has significant elevation 
of LFTs. Low suspicion for cholestatic picture as bili not 
elevated and patient had negative lipase.
 
# Metabolic acidosis: Most likely lactic acidosis in combination 
with renal failure. Lactate decreased form 4.6 to 2.3 with 
fluids.

# Wheezing: On home flovent and Spiriva, though no record of 
diagnosed pulmonary disease. In the MICU duonebs and home 
bronchodilators were given.

CCU PREOPERATIVE COURSE ___ - ___
===============================
#NSTEMI: Likely ischemic/Type I NSTEMI given newly depressed 
LVEF and new severe MR with ongoing elevations of cardiac 
biomarkers, now complicated by acute decompensated HFrEF. No 
evidence of GIB to suggest alternative demand ischemia at this 
point. LHC on ___ showing severe L main disease and 3VD with 
IABP placement for mechanical support. Trop/Mb peaked during her 
stay with normalization of her lactate. Patient was continued on 
ASA 81 mg, Atorvastatin, and heparin gtt. Plavix was held as she 
was being worked up for CABG. In light of her history of recent 
SAH (___) and GI bleeding, patient was evaluated and cleared 
by GI and Neurosurgery for CABG intervention. Patient underwent 
CABG on ___ and transferred to Cardiac Surgery.
 
#Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
#Acute decompensated HFrEF: Likely secondary to acute ischemic 
cardiomyopathy with newly depressed LVEF. CXR with evidence of 
pulmonary edema with elevated JVP. Patient was diuresed 
successfully with PRN Lasix boluses. Decision to start beta 
blocker and/or afterload reduction was deferred until post-CABG 

#Acute on chronic anemia: Unclear etiology given recent EGD with 
no evidence of bleed. Patient also without bloody stools but 
received 2 U RBCS during her stay. Patient was evaluated by GI 
and given lack of evidence of active bleeding, endoscopic 
procedure was not warranted at this time

#Acute on CKD: 1.3 baseline, initially uptrending due to 
cardiorenal syndrome given volume overloaded and worsening Cr 
with IVF and pRBCs. Cr was 2.4 up from 1.8 on admission but had 
improved to 1.4 prior to CVICU transfer with diuresis as above 

#Transaminitis: Likely elevated in the setting of shock liver 
from hypotension, downtrending with improvement in hemodynamics

===============  
CHRONIC ISSUES  
===============  
# Depression: continue citalopram
# Insomnia: continue trazadone 50mg qHS

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
-CT A/P with complex ovarian cyst (PCP not mentioned to patient) 
new since ___. DO NOT MENTION YET TO PATIENT
-Slightly hyperdense nodule in the left parotid gland as 
described above, partially evaluated in this exam, correlation 
with parotid gland ultrasound is recommended. 

POSTOPERATIVE COURSE (___)
=====================================
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
she underwent 
Mitral valve repair (28mm ring) with closure of anterior A3 
cleft) and CABGx3(lima-LAD, svg-RCA, svg-OM). She came out on 
significant inotropic and vasopressor support and a lactic acid 
of 3.9 which subsequently decreased after albumin bolus and 
decreasing the Epinephrine gtt. She required significant fluid 
resuscitation post op until POD2 when she was started on a Lasix 
gtt and given intermittent doses of Diuril. IABP was removed on 
arrival from OR due to migration of the catheter. She had brief 
hypotension after removal but improved with increased 
Neosynephrine gtt for support, which was later weaned down for 
SBP goal > 100. Required multiple blood transfusions during her

Brief Hospital Course:
ID: ___ yo male with PMH of CAD who was recently admitted 
(___) for 4 vessel CABG who presented with mild dyspnea 
on exertion and EKG changes with elevation of cardiac biomarkers 
concerning for graft stenosis no s/p cardiac catheterization 
yesterday . 
.  
# CORONARIES: Patient had known 4 vessel disease and was s/p 
bypass graft on ___. He had been recovering well until he 
began to feel somewhat unwell several days prior to admission. 
He also began to notice mild dyspnea on exertion without chest 
pain, orthopnea, PND. His dyspnea was thought to be his anginal 
equivalent. Given the fact that the patient's troponin was 
slightly elevated, a diagnossi of non-ST elevation MI was made.
.
Pt was given 600mg plavix load and mucomyst pre/post treatment 
for dye. Repeat cath on ___ revealed that the SVGs were 
occluded and that LIMA lead to diffusely diseased vessel 
unlikely to provide significant cardiac perfusion. During cath, 
balloned OM1. Per interventional cardiology, pt will need to 
return for another cath for stenting of SVG-diag in ___ weeks 
after acute changes from initial bypass have quieted down since 
the stenting will likely take place in one of the bypassed 
vessels. Whil in hospital pt continued on ASA and metoprolol at 
home doses. Lisinopril was increased from 10mg to 20mg daily and 
statin was changed to Rovastatin 20mg daily in order to optimize 
medical management. Unfortunately, the patient has had rather 
rapid failure of his bypass grafts.  
.  
# PUMP: Patient has known depressed systolic function (EF 
___. He has no signs of volume overload on admission. He was 
continued on home ACE-I and BB as noted above. Repeat TTE on 
___ showed anterior, septal and apical akinesis with 
depressed EF that was overal similar to prior ECHO but did not 
show hoped for improvement in systolic function after bypass.
.  
#Diabetes Mellitus II: Patient's last A1c was 7.1%. He has been 
managed at home with metformin 850 mg po tid and with insulin- 
novolin and novolog for his diabetes. He has had several 
episodes of hypoglycemia recently and his blood sugar may be too 
tightly controlled. While in house, we  decreased novolin from 
40 mg BID to 20 mg BID given recent low ___ and in light of that 
patient will be NPO for tomorrow's cath. Kept on ISS to cover 
high sugars and metformin held during hospitalization in light 
of cardiac cath and associated dye load. 
.  
# Hyperlipidemia: well controlled. last lipids well controlled 
on ___- TC 104, HDL 37, LDL 48. As above, statin changed to 
Rovastatin 20mg daily to optimize lipid reduction in setting of 
bad coronary disease with little available as interventional 
options and all efforts being made to optimize medical 
management. 
.
# Hypertension: currently well-controlled. Continued on home 
metoprolol and lisinopril.

Studies:
___ Echo: 
Conclusions  
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal (abnormal septal motion). 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 
55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
regional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. 
Mild mitral regurgitation. Increased PCWP. 
 
___ Chest xray:
IMPRESSION:  
Increased bibasilar interstitial opacities without evidence of 
pulmonary 
vascular congestion are more concerning for infection rather 
than edema.

for hypertensive urgency with diastolic heart failure requiring 
blood pressure control and diuresis with good effect. Patient 
did report some substernal chest pain but trops are negative and 
EKG is without any significant ST-T wave changes to suggest 
ischemic heart disease causing hypertensive urgency.  Patient 
reports consistently taking her home medications which puts 
rebound of short-acting antihypertensive agents less likely. 
This resolved

History of Present Illness:
___ yr old man who presented to ___ on ___ with 
shortness of breath. He was in his usual state of health until 
he woke up suddenly on ___ at 4am short of breath, with chest 
pressure. He had no associated dipahoresis, nausea, vomiting, or 
arm pain. It got progressively worse over the morning, and 
finally went to the ___ at 8am. He never had anything like 
this before. CXR showed CHF. BNP of 451. His symptoms were 
thought to be secondary to COPD exacerbation. Echocardiogram

ECG ___
Sinus rhythm with atrial premature complexes. Intra-atrial 
conduction defect. Right bundle-branch block with left anterior 
hemiblock. 

Cardiac Catheterization ___. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA 
had a distal 30% lesion.  The LAD had mild diffuse disease 
throughout its length.  The LCx had a 70-80% lesion at the 
ostium.  The RCA had mild diffuse disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamic measurement revealed severely 
elevated left sided filling pressure, with LVEDP of 36mmHg.  The 
systemic arterial pressure was normal at 137/66 mmHg.  There was 
no gradient upon careful pullback from the left ventricle to the 
aorta.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred given reduced GFR.

Echocardiogram ___
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. There is moderate to severe global left 
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). LV systolic function 
appears depressed. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild 
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is no pericardial effusion.  

Carotid ultrasound ___
There is calcific plaque involving the origin of the internal 
carotid arteries bilaterally and some wall thickening involving 
the left common carotid artery. However, the peak systolic 
velocities bilaterally are normal as are the ICA/CCA ratios. 
There is also normal antegrade flow involving the left vertebral 
artery, the right vertebral artery was not visualized, presumed 
hypoplastic or occluded. 

CXR ___
There is mild cardiomegaly and moderate tortuosity of the 
thoracic aorta. The lung volumes are within the normal range, on 
the lateral radiograph, however, moderate flattening of the 
hemidiaphragms is seen. This could suggest mild overinflation. 
The lung parenchyma shows slightly increased diameter of the 
upper lobe pulmonary vasculature, suggestive of basal apical 
blood flow redistribution due to increased intravascular fluid 
volume. There is no evidence of pleural effusion, however, 
subtle marking of the fissures with fluid is observed. Focal 
parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia are not seen. The 
mediastinum is relatively dense, but no mediastinal or hilar 
abnormalities are seen. There is a wedge-shaped vertebral 
compression at the thoracolumbar junction. Post-surgical devices 
projecting over the right shoulder.

Cultures: 
___ blood * 2 - NGTD
___ urine - NGTD, sputum - oropharyngeal flora (prelim)
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo man with H/O hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, known 
cardiomyopathy with LVEF 30% and moderate aortic stenosis, who 
presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a 
NSTEMI (peak troponin-I 0.12, troponin-T 0.06) now s/p 
catheterization on ___ that showed single vessel disease not 
favorable for PCI (ostial circumflex lesion). He was referred 
for CABG but developed a hospital acquired pneumonia and acute 
renal failure, delaying his surgery.  

# HAP - Infiltrate, leukocytosis, along with increased sputum 
production suggested likely pneumonia. In the context of several 
day hospital stay, prednisone use, and unknown PCN allergy, the 
patient was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam 
on ___ for a ___ PICC was placed on ___ for 
antibiotics and the patient was given tylenol for fevers. The 
patient was cultured at the time of fever spike on ___. 
Cultures are without growth to date.  

# CAD: Catheterization showed severe disease at origin LCx and 
mild disease of left main. No interventions performed. Plan was 
to proceed to CABG, but this was deferred due to fever and 
pneumonia. He has been continued on medical management with ASA, 
high dose statin, beta-blockade. His lisinopril was stopped in 
the setting of renal insufficiency and a history of hyperkalemia 
while on an ACE-I. The patient has an outpatient follow up 
appointment with Dr. ___ Cardiac ___ (CXR and labs 
prior) to reschedule his CABG.

# Pump: Echo showed EF of 30%, mild symmetric LVH, and global LV 
hypokinesis, consistent with acute on chronic LV systolic and 
diastolic heart failure. The patient was aggresively diuresed 
upon arrival. He was felt to remain slightly hypervolemic 
although diuresis was limited by development of acute renal 
failure.  Strict I/Os and daily weights were followed although 
there is no known dry weight for this patient. As the patient is 
on multiple, frequent antibiotics, his fluid intake is currently 
quite high. He was started on Lasix 40 mg BID and should be 
maintained on this regimen until his pneumonia treatment is 
complete. He should then return to a 40 mg daily dosing regimen. 
If, however, his I/Os are positive for >1 day, diuretics dosing 
should be addressed after considering insensible losses.

# Rhythm: Patient was monitored on tele and remained in normal 
sinus rhythm aside from infrequent PVCs and a 3 beat run of SVT.

# COPD: Patient had in-house PFTs obtained with a FEV1/FVC ratio 
of 66% (FEV1 1.6, FVC 2.4); TLC was 4.5, RFC 2.4. PFTs 
consistent with mild restrictive ventilatory defect with 
moderate gas exchange defect from an interstitial process. O2 
saturations were >95% on RA although he was, at times, placed on 
2L NC for patient comfort. He was given Solumedrol IV for COPD 
exacerbation at the OSH and was converted to prednisone 40 mg 
PO. He was tapered and currently maintained on prednisone 20 mg 
daily in setting of pneumonia with bronchospastic component. He 
should be tapered to 10 mg on ___ and continue 10 mg on ___ 
and ___. His last steroid dose should be on ___.  He was also 
treated with Singulair, Xopenex, Tiotropium, Advair, and 
Montelukast on advise of the pulmonary consult service. He 
should be maintained on these meds. He was also given PRN 
ipratropium which provided relief.

# Acute renal failure: This was felt to be pre-renal in origin 
given recent aggressive diuresis. Max creatinine was 1.6. 
Diuresis was held for 3 days and restarted in setting of 
decreasing creatinine and large volume intake with antibiotics. 
Current creatinine at 1.4. CT surgery was comfortable with CABG 
as long as creatinine <1.5. Plan to recheck prior to f/u CT 
sugery appoitment.    

# Diabetes mellitus type 2: Patient was maintained on SSI with 
QID FSBS and had values in the high 200s and low 300s. As a 
result, he was started on Lantus 5 units ___ and increased to 8 
on ___ for FSBS in the mid ___. Plan to continue to monitor 
FSBS QID with current lantus dosing and sliding scale coverage 
with adjustments as outpatient.

# BPH: Patient was maintained on Flomax and Proscar per 
outpatient regimen.  

On ___, the patient had a PICC placed for antibiotic use, was 
walking with ___ with ambulatory sats in the mid ___ on room air, 
and was felt to be appropriate for discharge to an extended care 
facility in good condition with follow up scheduled with CT 
surgery. Communication was/is with the patient and his 
daughter's ___ ___ and ___ ___ who are 
actively involved in his care.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to ___ because you were 
found to have congestive heart failure. You had an 
echocardiogram which showed decreased pumping function as a 
result of damage to the heart muscle. You also had a slight 
increase in a blood marker that is used to test for heart muscle 
damage. This means you have suffered some strain on your heart. 
Much of this was likely a result of decreased pumping that 
caused back up of fluids causing your shortness of breath. You 
were aggressively diuresed with lasix to remove the extra 
fluids.

You also had a cardiac catheterization which showed 30% blockage 
in your left mainstem artery and 80% blockage in your left 
circumflex artery effectively decrease the blood supply to your 
heart muscle. The resulting plan was to proceed to CABG 
operation to by-pass these arteries.

Unfortunately, your kidney function was also slightly abnormal 
and, while waiting for it to improve, you developed a pneumonia. 
Because you had been in the hospital for several days prior to 
developing the pneumonia, it needed to be treated as per a 
hospital-acquired pneumonia protocol. Since your kidney function 
looks improved but you need a 7 day course of antibiotics for 
your pneumonia, you are going to an extended care facility prior 
to your CABG.

You have a follow up appointment with Dr. ___. You will 
address rescheduling your CABG at that time. You should also 
have blood work done prior to this appointment.

Please call alert the healthcare staff of your extended care 
facility if you have worsening swelling in your arms, legs or 
abdomen, shortness of breath, chest pain, pressure, or 
tightness, nausea, fever, chills, difficulty laying flat or 
waking up short of breath or any other concerning symptoms.

History of Present Illness:
___ female with h/o tricuspid valve replacement requiring 
chronic anticoagulation who is admitted for liver biopsy. In ___ 
of this year she developed abdominal pain. Workup eventually 
revealed cirrhosis and diffuse infiltration of her liver with 
masses. Imaging including CT and MRI was suggestive of HCC, and 
AFP was ___, but given that there is a differential 
diagnosis of diseases which would be treated very differently, 
it was recommended in liver tumor board that biopsy be pursued 
for definitive diagnosis. She requires careful anticoagulation 
management and has a history of quickly forming clots when off 
anticoagulation in the past, so she is admitted for close 
observation. 

She feels okay on admission but continues to have problems with 
abdominal distension. Can only eat small amounts at a time. Has 
not eaten since midnight as instructed. She has lower leg edema 
which has gotten worse.

IMAGING:
CXR ___
IMPRESSION:  
Status post cardiac surgery. Massive cardiomegaly.  No overt 
pulmonary edema.  New left PICC line shows a normal course. The 
tip projects over the mid to low SVC.  No pleural effusions. 

Liver biopsy ___ - prelim verbal report c/w hepatocellular 
carcinoma but final results pending in ___
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: ___ female with prosthetic valve requiring 
anticoagulation, liver cirrhosis and extensive infiltration with 
liver masses admitted for liver biopsy

# HCC: Immaging with extensive liver involvement of metastatic 
disease. Pt has h/o cirrhosis as below, and ___ confirmed on 
prelim biopsy ___. Started FOLFOX ___ and tolerated this 
well. PICC placed for chemo ___ and pulled prior to discharge 
with plan for her to have port placed as an outpatient. She has 
follow up with her oncologist ___. Sent home with prn zofran 
and compazine for nausea.

# Hyponatremia: Hypervolumic related to cirrhosis and end stage 
liver disease, asymptomatic. Initially her lasix was held and 
her hyponatremia worsened, nadiring at 125, but when her home 
dose 40mg daily lasix was restarted it began to improve. Sodium 
was stable in the mid-high 120s throughout. This may be new 
baseline for her. UNa <10 inconsistent with SIADH. She has 
follow up to have this rechecked later this week.

# Mechanical tricuspid valve: Chronically anticoagulated. 
Possible right atrial thrombus seen on CT chest ___. Was on 
warfarin at home but bridged with lovenox for liver biopsy as 
above. At this point, she will continue lovenox for 
anticoagulation indefinitely given that she will need to come in 
for port placement and be bridged again anyway, but moreover the 
multiple interactions between warfarin and chemotherapy make 
warfarin titration problematic in this setting. 
   
# Cirrhosis: Cardiac cirrhosis from congenital heart disease. 
Chronic, end stage liver disease with confirmed HCC on bx ___ 
on recent biopsy complicated by ascites, hyponatremia and portal 
hypertension. Pt has follow up in liver clinic for ___. It 
seems she would require EGD if not already done at another 
institution as there are no records of EGD in OMR. During this 
admission she had lower extremity edema in the setting of lasix 
discontinuation, which was improving at the time of discharge 
after lasix was restarted. 
   
# Transaminitis - Tbili newly elevated on admission (5.6) but 
was trending down slowly at the time of discharge though 
remained elevated (3.9). MRI liver showed no obstruction, and 
she is already on anticoagulation were there to be any 
thrombotic component at play (less likely given chronic 
anticoagulation). Likely this is related to extensive tumor 
involvement of the liver.  

# Leukocytosis - Pt presented with WBC up to 16 which remained 
stable throughout the admission and was discharged with WBC of 
14. There was nothing to suggest infection throughout her 
hospital course, no dysuria, fever, cough, pain, diarrhea. This 
was considered to be reactive in the setting of malignancy but 
she was instructed to call her doctor should any new symptoms 
develop.

# Atrial Fibrillation - continued digoxin, diltiazem, and pt on 
lovenox as above.
  
# COPD: Chronic, stable. Continued advair.
    
# Pain - continued oxycontin/oxycodone
  
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Pt needs labs checked the week after discharge primarily for 
Na/electrolyte evaluation and also LFT trend.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for biopsy of your liver. We stopped your 
warfarin and you are now taking lovenox for anticoagulation 
(blood thinning). The biopsy showed cancer of the liver and 
chemotherapy (called FOLFOX) was started on ___ which you 
tolerated well.

While you were here, your sodium was low. This is likely because 
your lasix was temporarily stopped and when we restarted this 
your sodium improved. Also, you had worsening fluid in your legs 
which was due to holding the lasix and when we restarted lasix 
that improved as well. You should continue your usual regimen of 
40mg po lasix daily at home. Weigh yourself daily and if you 
weight goes up more than 3 pounds and your legs appear 
significantly swollen, you may take an extra 20mg of PO lasix 
that day. Please call your doctor if you are needing to take the 
extra 20mg pill more than twice a week. Please continue to wear 
the compression stockings.

You will have a follow up appointment with Dr. ___ coming 
week. He will contact you with details.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old Male who presents from ___ with acute 
on chronic systolic CHF in the setting of recent aortic valve 
replacement. The patient was initially operated on ___ with a 
tissue valve which was done for critical aortic stenosis by Dr. 
___. He returned on ___ with a left groin hematoma and MSSA 
bacteremia which was from the sternotomy wound infection. This 
was consulted on by plastics surgery who operated on ___ and he 
was started on nafcillin for 6 weeks and a JP drain was placed, 
and sent to cardiac rehab on ___.
The morning of admission he was noted to be markedly dyspneic at 
rehab, and was sent to the ED at ___. There he was 
noted to be markedly anemic along with a severely elevated BNP 
of 246 (normal <64). He was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs. He was 
noticed to have asymetric pedal edema. A foley was placed to 
monitor diuresis, which unfortunately was a traumatic placement, 
and he had frank hematuria. He was given an additional 40mg IV 
Lasix. A chest x-ray there demonstrated small left pleural 
effusion, elevated hemidiaphragm (old) and bibasilar 
atelectasis. He was then transferred to ___ given recent 
surgery and concern with acute CHF in the perioperative period.
When he presented to the ED he was on 2L of 02 with 100% SAO2. 
Given the asymetric leg swelling a CTA-Chest was performed which 
was negative for PE. It did note increased fluid collection in 
the sternal wound. He reports that after the diuresis and 
transfusion his dyspnea did improve. He still feels unwell and 
not at his baseline.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of ___ 
9:32 ___  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2.  Status post interval revision of sterntomy with drain 
placement.  Interval increase in size of a presternal fluid 
collection now measuring 12.9 x 2.2 cm, with a similar degree of 
surrounding stranding, but now containing a surgical drain.   
3.  Slight new resorption along upper sternotomy margins, which 
may be an 
early healing response although there is no bony bridging; bone 
infection 
cannot be excluded by this study, however.
4.  Basilar opacities, probably atelectasis, with a small 
right-sided pleural effusion. 
 
TTE ___
Conclusions  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis 
is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, 
with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot 
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic 
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] No masses or vegetations are seen 
on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to 
suboptimal image quality. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. There are no valvular 
vegigations seen on transthoracic echo, however this would be 
better evaluated with TEE. Well-seated, normally functioning AV 
bioprothesis. Mild symmetric LVH with preserved regional and 
global biventricular systolic function. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ the 
degree of tricuspid regurgitation has decreased

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Medicine Course
Acute systolic CHF: The patient presented from his cardiac 
rehabilitation facility with dyspnea on exertion. He was found 
to have an elevated BNP on evaluation, and his respiratory 
status improved following administration of 40mg lasix in the 
OSH ED. He additionally relates a history of orthopnea and 
recent increase in lower extremity edema, leading to suspicion 
for volume overload in the setting of heart failure as the cause 
for his dyspnea. There is no evidence of a suddent right sided 
event such as a PE based on the CTA. Abdominal and Pelvic CTA 
showed 4.6 x 3.1 cm fluid collection adjacent to the left common 
femoral vessels, which may represent a prior hematoma. The study 
was not tailored for evaluation for active bleeding, but the 
fluid in this collection is low density without evidence for 
extravasation of contrast. There is no evidence of an acute MI 
by troponin. The patient's most recent echocardiogram, s/p AVR, 
noted a depressed EF of 40-45%, however, a TTE done on admission 
showed a normal preserved EF. Cardiology was consulted, who felt 
that the patient's presentation was consistent with acute CHF, 
and the patient was started on BID lasix with strict I/Os and 
volume restriction. 

Sternotomy Wound Abscess: the patient was evaluated by plastic 
surgery, who elected not to remove his JP drain on ___ as 
previously scheduled due to the interval increase in size of 
fluid collection on CT scan. The JP drain will be removed by 
plastic surgery in ___ weeks as an outpatient. The patient was 
continued on nafcillin for MSSA coverage on admission. 

Atrial Fibrillation: the patient was noted to be in sinus rhythm 
on admission. He was continued on his home amiodarone and 
metoprolol regimen. His INRs were 2.2 and 2.1 on admission, and 
he was continued on his warfarin regimen with goal INR ___. 
Frank hematuria: the patient presented with frank hematuria due 
to traumatic foley placement at the OSH before transfer to 
___. He has a history of BPH but did not recently have any 
urinary retention. His foley catheter was removed on hospital 
day 1 and he passed his voiding trial, with rapid clearing of 
the hematuria.
 
Peripheral Neuropathy: the patient was continued on his home 
regimen of gabapenin, lidocaine, and tramadol on admission. 

On HD3, he was transferred to the cardiac service.  He was 
transfused 1 unit PRBC for Hct 27.7, which increased to 28.6.  
He was continued on Coumadin for Atrial fibrillation with a 
therapeutic INR.  He was diuresed with Lasix BID + Zaroxyln with 
improvement of shortness of breath. CXR showed small bilateral 
pleural effusions.  Plastic surgery was re-consulted to evaluate 
possibility of discontinuing the JP drain but the drains are to 
remain in place until his follow up appointment with Dr. ___. 
By HD 5, he was ambulating in the hallways with a walker, 
tolerating a full po diet, his hematocrit was stable, and his 
edema had decreased. He is to continue with Nafcillin for a 6 
week course via PICC for MSSA bacteremia.  He is to remain on 
Lasix po for peripheral edema and diastolic heart failure until 
follow up visit with Dr ___. It was felt he was safe for 
tranfer to ___ rehab at this time.

CT chest ___
IMPRESSION:
1. Two lung lesions are suspicious for malignancy, a 16-mm right 
upper lobe lesion contiguous with an area of partially-resolved 
pneumonia, unchanged since ___ and a nearly 3 cm 
subpleural right lower lobe mass increased in size slightly in 
the interim.
2. Moderate-to-severe emphysema.
3. Multifocal pneumonia substantially cleared and pleural 
effusions decreased or resolved.
4. One small liver lesion warranting ulstrasound study.

___ CXR
 In comparison with the study of ___, the degree of pulmonary 
vascular congestion has substantially decreased. Bilateral 
pleural effusions are seen, much worse on the left. Probable 
atelectatic changes at the bases, again more prominent on the 
left. There is some patchy opacification just above the minor 
fissure on the right. In view of the high fever, this could 
represent a developing pneumonia and should be carefully 
evaluated on subsequent studies.

___ KUB
Air-fluid levels are consistent with ileus; no evidence of 
complete bowel obstruction.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to Red Surgery for management of her 
SBO and abdominal pain.  The patient was initially managed 
conservatively with NGT decompression and NPO status.  The 
patient continued on TPN as she was on at home.  The patient 
failed conservative management, so the decision was made to take 
the patient to the operating room.  On ___, the patient 
underwent a laparotomy, lysis of adhesion, enterocolostomy,small 
bowel biopsy.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no 
complications and an EBL of 100cc.  For further detail of the 
procedure please refer to the operative note.  Post operatively, 
the patient was hypotensive and started on a Neo drip, and she 
was then transfered to the TICU for further care.  On POD 2 the 
patient was febrile to 103.8 and weaned off neo.  On ___, her 
PICC was removed and TLC placed. GPC's were found in blood so 
Vanco was started.  On ___, she developed new AF w/RVR, was 
started on a dilt/lasix gtt, and an ECHO done was normal.  
Furthermore, her Ucx was positive w/Ecoli so she was started on 
cipro and later changed to Gent ___ fluoroquinolone resistance. 
On ___ the patient was transfered to the floor in fair 
condition and rate controlled.  The patient's discharge was 
delayed secondary to physical therapy concerns about the 
patient's independence status.  Furthermore, secondary to the 
patient's poor po intake, TPN was continued.  On ___ the 
patient spiked a temp to 101.5 and the CVL was d/c'd and the 
patient maintained on D10W until PICC could be placed.  On ___, 
the patient self d/c'd her PICC accidentally.  On ___ a PICC 
was replaced via ___ without complication.  Upon discharge, the 
patient was afebrile with all vitals stable other than O2 
saturation, ambulating on O2 independently, tolerating po feeds 
but still on TPN, and with pain controlled on po pain 
medication.

Physical therapy was consulted to help rehabilitate the patient. 
 The patient progressed well with physical therapy, but the 
ultimate decision was made to d/c the patient home with oxygen 
___ desaturations to the mid 80's on ambulation.  

The spiculated lung mass found on CT was refered to 
interventional pulmonology for work up and management.  The 
patient will be managed as an outpatient and will be discussed 
in ___ clinic.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 12:38 AM 
1. New retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy particularly along the 
left paraaortic chain, with a couple of these lymph nodes 
demonstrating central hypodensity suggesting necrosis. 
Additionally, a retroperitoneal mass located along the right 
renal hilum, which appears to be separate from the adjacent 
right kidney and adrenal gland likely represents a lymph node 
with central area of either hemorrhage or necrosis, associated 
with right retroperitoneal stranding. The larger mass does not 
appear to represent a separate disease process, however. The 
etiology is suspicious for malignancy, but given infectious 
symptoms, an usual infection or abscess formation with the 
largest node should be considered. 
  
2. Nodular soft tissue with coarse calcification in the right 
breast is as 
previously seen on mammography. 
  
3. Moderate hiatal hernia containing debris. 
  
4. Trace pleural effusions with dependent atelectasis.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with history of hypertension, HFrEF
(EF 18%), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and
nonischemic cardiomyopathy who presents as transfer for
tachycardia requiring diltiazem drip. 

Patient reports that he woke up around 6AM with palpitations and
a rapid heart rate. He felt lightheaded but had no shortness of
breath or chest pain. He went to an outside hospital where he 
was
found to be in SVT. He converted after 12mg IV adenosine, had a
recurrent episode of SVT, was given 12mg IV adenosine again and
converted again but was then found to be in atrial fibrillation
(no history) with HR 110-120s. He received IV boluses of
diltiazem and was started on a dilt drip.

Of note, patient was recently hospitalized at ___ after presenting on ___ with dyspnea and leg
swelling x1 week. BNP 3172, TTE diagnosed new HFrEF with EF 18%.
Cath confirmed nonischemic cardiomyopathy. He was negative for
hepatitis C, iron overload, HIV, TSH, and it was thought that 
his
excessive alcohol use played a role. He had a few episodes of
paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia while admitted and
carvedilol was started at 12.5mg BID. He was discharged on Lasix
20mg PO daily, Entresto (to replace hydral and iso) and an event
monitor to wear for one month.

reported taking 40mg Lasix daily at home which was continued 
while inpatient. He was continued on home entresto BID and was 
started on eplerenone. He is to take eplerenone every other day 
until demonstrated that his potassium is stable. He will require 
careful monitoring of potassium in the week after discharge. 

#Type II NSTEMI type II i/s/o of tachycardia 
Patient presented with troponin-T elevation to 0.12. This was 
considered to be demand ischemia in the setting of A. fib with 
RVR. There were no concerning ST changes on EKG. The troponins 
were trended to peak 0.16. 

Chronic Issues:
===============
# GOUT
- continued home allopurinol ___ daily

#History of SVT:

dedicated CT imaging as an outpatient. 

Transitional Issue: 
==================
[ ] Hx of AVNRT: does patient require ablation will have to 
assess if ablation indicated in the future
[ ] Started eplerenone will need K monitoring. Once K has been 
demonstrated to be stable can advance to daily. Please follow up 
complete metabolic panel on ___.
[ ] Monitoring of blood pressure: please ensure patient is not 
hypotensive on current regimen. Carvedilol was increased from 
home dosage.

Chest x ray ___
FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The 
lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no overt edema or signs of 
pneumonia.  There is minimal diffuse ground-glass opacity which 
could represent a very mild 
pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony 
structures are intact.  No free air below the right 
hemidiaphragm.  The heart is top normal in size. 
IMPRESSION:  COPD, possible mild pulmonary edema. 

___ TTE
Conclusions  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional 
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular 
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated 
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve is mildly thickened and probably bicuspid. There is 
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.   

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
gastroesophogeal reflux, and a 45 pack-year smoking history who 
presented with an episode of lightheadedness, shortness of 
breath, and unsteady gait in the setting of increased 
sleepiness, and chronic cough over the preceding 6 months to ___ 
year and increased lower extremity edema over the last 1 month. 
Patient was awaiting CPAP machine in the mail and was currently 
undergoing vascular assessment for suspected venous 
insufficiency as an outpatient. Patient presented by ambulance 
from his home. Symptoms improved with oxygen in the ambulance. 
In the Emergency department, patient was hypertensive to 200/100 
and saturating 97% on 4 liters by nasal cannula. He was 
transferred to the medical floor in stable condition.

#COPD: Chronic cough and subjective shortness of breath 
secondary to undiagnosed and untreated COPD without past 
spirometry. In the ED, the patient received methylprednisolone, 
prednisone 20mg, albuterol, ipratropium, and azithromycin. His 
chest X-ray, physical exam, and labs (Hematocrit 53.2, HCO3- 33) 
were classic for COPD. Given his chronically stable cough 
without change in sputum production, bronchospasm, or evidence 
of infection it was felt that he was not having a COPD 
exacerbation, but rather untreated COPD was contributing to his 
complaints of daytime sleepiness and shortness of breath. 
Patient was given albuterol and ipatropium nebulizers during his 
hospitalization and his oxygenation and subjective feeling of 
shortness of breath improved. He was discharged with 
prescriptions for albuterol and ipatropium, received inhaler 
education, and scheduled for an outpatient pulmonology 
appointment. He expressed a desire to quit smoking and was 
prescribed a nicotine patch and education on quitting. He was 
provided with close follow-up with his primary care physician.

#Obstructive Sleep Apnea(OSA): Patient with multiple risk 
factors for OSA who stated he was suppose to be receiving a CPAP 
machine in the mail and was to be fitted. History of daytime 
sleepiness, fatigue, night time awakenings, and snoring was 
consistent with obstructive sleep apnea. He was provided with a 
CPAP machine overnight and slept well with subsequent 
improvement in symptoms. Likely OSA played a large part in his 
symptoms including his suspected pulmonary hypertension, heart 
failure, and lower extremity edema. He will benefit from CPAP at 
home, which he stated was to be arriving soon. He was scheduled 
for outpatient pulmonology and primary care appointments to 
further assess his disease.   

#Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: Left sided diastolic 
congestive heart failure in the setting of hypertension likely 
contributing to dyspnea and lower extremity edema. An EKG was 
performed which showed evidence of prior anteroseptal myocardial 
infarction and suggestion of acute inferolateral ischemia. 
Cardiac enzymes were trended and remained negative times 3 with 
a BNP of 304. He was monitored on telemetry throughout his 
hospitalization without any events. A transthoracic echo was 
performed showing a LVEF >75% and left atrial enlargement, 
consistent with diastolic dysfunction. A chest X-Ray showed 
pulmonary edema which was also consistent with congestive heart 
failure and worsening shortness of breath. His lisinopril was 
upped from 20mg to 40 mg daily and his atenolol was decreased to 
25mg. He was provide with close cardiology follow-up at 
discharge.    

#Smoking cessation: ___ pack year history, was smoking 
approximately 1 pack of cigarettes a day. Patient stated he had 
been trying to quit and was previously successful for greater 
than ___ years. He stated his primary care physician was suppose 
to be mailing him a medication to assist him with smoking 
cessation, but he has not received it in the mail. He requested 
and received a nicotine patch in the hospital as well as further 
education on smoking cessation. He was asked to follow-up with 
his primary care physician regarding continued use of the patch 
and slow down titration. 

Patient remained stable throughout the course of his 
hospitalization. He was discharged home with close follow-up 
with his primary care physician, ___, and pulmonology. 
All other chronic conditions were managed without complications. 
He remained full code throughout his admission.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. 

You were admitted for lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and 
increasing fatigue.  Chest X-ray and blood labs were consistent 
with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) which partly 
explains your chronic cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. 
The most important step to improving COPD is to quit smoking and 
to use the inhalers as prescribed. You were given education in 
the hospital on how to use these inhalers. You will be sent home 
with a prescription for nicotine patches to help you quit 
smoking and will need to follow-up with your primary care 
physician. Also, it will be important for you to follow-up with 
the pulmonologist to get the appropriate lung test and optimize 
your medication regimen for your COPD.

We also feel obstructive sleep apnea is contributing to your 
frequent night time awakenings, daytime sleepiness, high blood 
pressure, and shortness of breath. You were started on a CPAP 
machine during the night of your hospitalization with 
improvement in your sleep and daytime symptoms. Please make sure 
to get fit for your CPAP and use it while sleeping to improve 
your breathing. 

We were also concerned with your heart given your lower leg 
swelling and high blood pressure. An EKG was performed which did 
now show evidence of an acute heart attack. However, you have 
likely suffered a small heart attack in the past based on the 
EKG findings. The ultrasound of your heart is consistent with 
congestive heart failure. Congestive heart failure can cause 
symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and swelling in the 
legs. It will be important for you to follow up with a 
cardiologist to further evaluate your heart disease. Your 
Lisinopril was increased to 40mg once daily. Your atenolol was 
decreased to 25mg once a day. Please take these medications as 
prescribed. 

We also discussed our concern over your alcohol consumption and 
potential implications on your liver and other organs. We 
advised you decreased your alcohol consumption to less than 14 
drinks per week and less than ___ drinks per day. 

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.

STUDIES:
MICRO: None
ECG: ___: A-V sequentially paced rhythm with capture and 
occasional atrial ectopy with ventricular response as well as 
atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm. No previous tracing 
available for comparison. 

ECG: ___: Sinus rhythm with atrial sensed and ventricular 
paced rhythm. Occasional 
atrial ectopy as well as A-V sequential paced rhythm. Compared 
to the previous 
tracing of ___ no diagnostic interim change. 
 
TTE: ___ Conclusions  
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due 
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may 
be significantly UNDERestimated.] The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a 
prominent fat pad. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Biatrial enlargement. Mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mildly reduced left 
ventricular systolic function. Regional wall motion 
abnormalities cannot be excluded in the setting of suboptimal 
image quality. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Mild aortic 
reurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Normal pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure.

ERCP: ___   
Impression: A single periampullary diverticulum was found at the 
major papilla.  
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a 
sphincterotome 
A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree with 
the CBD measuring 15 mm.  There were several round filling 
defects compatible with multipl stones in the bile duct at the 
biliary tree.  
Given these findings, a sphincterotomy was performed 
Then, a sphincteroplasty was performed using a CRE balloon from 
12 mm to 15 mm 
Several balloon sweeps were performed. 
Five large round yellowish stones and large amount of sludge 
were extracted successfully using a balloon. 
Filling defects showed no filling defects. 
Excellent flow of bile was noted. 
 
Recommendations: Return to floor under ongoing care. 
NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration with LR at 200 cc/hr. 

If no abdominal pain in the AM, advance diet to clear liquids 
and then advance as tolerated. 
Follow for response and complications. If any abdominal pain, 
fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call ERCP 
fellow on call (___) 
No plavix, coumadin for 5 days if appropiate 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an ___ year old male with a history of CAD s/p 7 
stents, CHF, DM, HL, history of GI bleed (colonic 
source/surgical site attachment), Afib, SSS s/p pacemaker, s/p 
CCY for grangrenous gall bladder, who presented with gallstone 
pancreatitis and was ruled out for acute coronary syndrome 
before undergoing ERCP with sphincterotomy and sphincteroplasty.

#Choledocholithiasis and pancreatitis- CT abd-pelvis at OSH 
showed mild fat stranding around the head of the pancreas, 
enlarged common bile duct (1.7cm) and several hyperdense stones. 
His ALT and AST were elevated. His ALP, lipase, amylase, total 
bilirubin and direct bilirubin were also elevated. On day 1 of 
his hospital stay at ___, acute cornary syndrome was ruled out 
as below. On day 2, ERCP was performed. A sphincterotomy 
followed by a sphincteroplasty was performed and five large 
round yellowish stones and large amount of sludge were 
extracted. Patient returned to floor for continued care. He was 
kept NPO overnight with IV hydration and his diet was advanced 
as tolerated and the following day he tolerated PO and was 
discharged home.  ERCP team felt that this resolved and patient 
would only need to f.u with PCP rather than ERCP team. His abd 
pain improved as well and he was d/c'd with no abdominal pain, 
eating and drinking well.

#r/o acute coronary syndrome- At ___ Troponin I 
was elevated at 0.876. EKG per report showed paced ryhthm. At 
the ___ ED, troponin T was 0.11, CK 649 and MB 11. ECG showed 
sinus, rate 79, intermittent paced rhythm, no clear ischemic 
changes. Of note Cr was elev 1.9 when he was admitted to ___ 
so it is possible that elevated Cr may have contributed to the 
elev trop. He was given 1L NS. On the floor he was also given 
aspirin 325, atorvastatin 80 and metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg. 
Patient denied any epigastric pain throughout his entire 
hospital course. His cardiac biomarkers were rechecked and were 
downtrending. Patient had an echo with an unchanged EF and no 
new wall motion abnormalities. Given normal echo and 
downtrending biomarkers, patient was cleared for ERCP.  Initial 
elevation of cardiac enzymes was thought to be secondary to 
prerenal failure (Cr 1.9 at its highest) in the setting of 
vomiting and decreased PO intake. Demand ischemia in the setting 
of pancreatitis and choledocholithiasis is also possible as 
well. He had no chest pain on day of d/c and was advised to f/u 
with his cardiologist for a stress test pMIBI as an outpatient.

#Macrocytic anemia: Patient was found to have a macrocytic 
anemia on this admission. B12 levels were found to be within 
normal limits. No further workup was performed.

___: prerenal failure (Cr 1.9 at its highest) in the setting of 
vomiting and decreased PO intake, Cr improved over hospital 
course on d.c was 1.0.

CHRONIC CONDITIONS:
Patient received his home doses of medications for CAD, gout, 
GERD, and BPH. Blood glucose was well controlled on a sliding 
scale. His lisinopril was held throughout his stay in the 
setting of elevated creatinine.

CODE STATUS: FULL

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to 
___ for chest and abdominal pain.  You were found to have many 
stones blocking your common bile duct.  You had a procedure 
called an ERCP which showed stones and sludge in your common 
bile duct, which were removed.  You tolerated the procedure well 
and you felt well had no more pain and were able to tolerate 
food on discharge. 

Your chest pain improved and your cardiac enzymes, while 
initially abnormal, improved during this admission.  You had an 
echocardiogram which was unchanged from your prior one.

Please follow up with your primary care doctor.

We also recommend that you make an appointment to see your 
cardiologist by next week because you should have a stress test 
to make sure your coronary arteries look ok and there are no new 
blockages.

IMAGING
=======
___: TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= ___ secondary 
to severe global hypokinesis with ? worse function of the 
inferolateral wall. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with 
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. [In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid 
regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality requiring use of Optison 
contrast. Normal left ventricular size with severe global 
systolic dysfunction and worse inferolateral hypokinesis 
suggestive of CAD. Dilated and hypokynetic right ventricle. 
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. 

___: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION: 
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Slight interval increase 
in right
pleural effusion is suspected, minimal. Right basal atelectasis 
in part
rounded is unchanged. Left lung is essentially clear. No 
evidence of pulmonary edema. Demonstrated.
 
Brief Hospital Course:

received furosemide bolus (120 mg IV lasix) followed by a 
furosemide drip at 10 mg/hour from ___ to ___ and 
was transitioned to torsemide 20 milligrams PO daily. During 
hospitalization patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram 
which showed an EF of ___ with ""severe global systolic 
dysfunction and worse inferolateral hypokinesis suggestive of 
CAD. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Moderate to severe 
tricuspid regurgitation."" This was drastically different than 
previous stress echocardiogram obtained ___ at ___ 
___ which showed overall left ventricular systolic function 
with an estimated LVEF of 55%, grade I diastolic dysfunction, no 
significant valvular heart disease. During that stress 
echocardiogram, there was ""evidence of inducible ischemia the 
level of stress achieved. Echo images demosntrated new reional 
wall motion abnormalities consistent with inducible apical 
septal and apical lateral hypokinesis. Baseline inferior apical 
lateral hypokinesis."" 

During hospitalization at ___, troponins initially elevavted 
at 0.09 but downtrended. This was thought to be secondary to 
volume overload and decompensated heart failure.   

Weight on admission 100 kilograms. 
Weight on discharge 81.3 kilograms.
Creatinine at time of discharge 1.3

Based on new findings of worsening EF with severe tricuspid 
regurgitation, recommendation was to follow-up with an 
outpatient adenosine MIBI to assess ejection fraction. Also may 
consider cardiac catheterization given likely coronary artery 
disease leading to reduced ejection fraction. 

Given heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, continued a 
medication regimen of lisinopril 5 mg PO daily, atorvastatin 40 
mg PO QPM, aspirin 81 mg PO daily, metoprolol succinate XL 25 mg 
PO daily, and torsemide 20 mg PO daily. 

#Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter: CHADS2 of at least 4 (age, 
hypertension, heart failure, diabetes). INR on admission 1.5. He 
was started on coumadin with a bridge with heparin drip. Goal 
INR ___. He was discharged with an INR of 3. Coumadin dose at 
the time of discharge was 2.5mg daily.  Plan for follow-up INR 
check on ___

#Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia: Occurred ___. 
Patient was hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic with HRs of 
150s. Max run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was 17 
beats. Etiology was unclear as electrolytes were within normal 
limits. He was continued on metoprolol as noted above.

#Chronic Kidney Disease: Cr basleine 1.4-1.6. Creatinine on 
admission 1.7. After diuresis, patient's creatinine at the time 
of discharge was 1.3.

#Altered Mental Status: Patient had several episodes of altered 
mental status presenting with confusion, somnolence. ABGs drawn 
at time were within normal limits. He also was noted to have 
intermittent ptosis that would change between R and L side. On 
discussion with his brother, his altered mental status has been 
ongoing for months, with negative workup previously. Confusion 
resolved with diuresis. 

#Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Cont Lantus at bedtime, and HISS. 
 
#Hypertension: Blood pressure during hospitalization well 
controlled. Patient was on lisinopril 5 mg PO daily and 
metoprolol succiante XL 25 mg PO daily at the time of discharge. 
 

#Hyperlipidemia: Continued on atorvastatin 40 mg PO daily. 

#Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine sodium 75 mcg PO 
daily.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after 
experiencing shortness of breath and increased swelling in your 
legs. This was secondary to a condition called congestive heart 
failure. In order to treat the breathing, you were placed on a 
diuretic drip to help you urinate and remove fluid from your 
body. This helped improve your breathing and decreased the 
swelling in your legs.

During hospitalization you were also re-started on your 
coumadin. Please continue to take the coumadin at 2.5mg. Please 
have your INR checked on ___ 

Given your history of heart failure, please weigh yourself every 
morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. Your weight 
at the time of discharge was 81.3kg.

It was pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization. 
We wish you all the best!

IMAGING:
=========
___: Non-Contrast Chest CT
1. No diffuse lung disease is identified to explain patient's 
symptoms. Focal area of interstitial fibrosis in the right 
middle lobe may be a sequel to prior infection.
2. No pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
3. Heavy coronary artery calcifications. Moderate calcification 
of aortic valve and possibly mitral annulus.
4. Benign, right adrenal adenoma.

___: ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%) secondary 
to akinesis of the apex and distal anterior septum. No masses or 
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.
Impression: Mild regional and global left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction c/w CAD. Increased LV filling pressure. Trace aortic 
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

weight gain, leg swelling, and cough over the last 2 weeks. 

#CHF: On admission patient's hx, leg swelling, CXR were all 
consistent with volume overload. Acute exacerbation thought to 
be due to diet/medication non-compliance. No evidence of acute 
MI given symptoms, EKG, and negative cardiac enzymes. ___ 
showed mild systolic dysfunction with an EF 40-45% (prior 55%), 
and mild PAH in setting of left dysfunction. Aside from diuresis 
patient was placed on a low salt diet, and 1L fluid restriction. 
Her discharge weight was 101.8.

#Hypoxia: Pt did not have home O2 PTA. Her cough and lung exam 
have improved w standing duonebs, but was still desatting w 
ambulation (87-89). Most recent PFTs were ___ and showed a more 
restrictive pattern than obstructive. CT Chest ___ without 
intersitial disease or COPD that would explain hypoxia. Likely 
multifactorial, w reduced chest wall compliance, CHF related 
effusions, and RAD playing a role. Patient needs an OSA 
screening/treatment at home but adamantly refuses (says she 
can't sleep with it). She will be discharged with prescription 
for 1L O2 on ambulation, and ___ for endurance.

#Asthma: Initially diffusely wheezy on exam and complaining of 
cough, very responsive to duonebs, continued throughout 
admission and she was discharged on home fluticasone and 
albuterol. Also had prn robitussin. Was well controlled during 
___ testing with ambulatory desats.

___: Patient initially had a creatinine bump to 2.2, which 
improved with diuresis back to her baseline of 1.6. Upon 
starting bumex 3mg BID she then bumped again to 2.4. Likely 
overly aggressive, was held and was trending down again on 
discharge (2.2). Needs follow up with BMP 2 days after discharge 
to ensure continues to trend down, and will go with 1mg bumex 
BID.

#T2DM: 
- home Glargine + Lispro were continued

#CAD: 
- continued home Atorvastatin 40mg qD
- continued home ASA 81mg QDay

#R shoulder pain: negative x-ray s/p fall 1 week ago w/ full 
ROM.  Most likely related to arthritis and exacerbated by fall. 
Xray negative for dislocation or fracture. Standing tylenol and 
oxycodone PRN helped manage pain.

#Anemia: Normocytic anemia with MCV 94. HgB near baseline of 
10.5 and remained stable.

presented following an episode of regular narrow complex 
tachycardia, consistent with possible AVNRT. 

======================
ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
======================

# Narrow complex tachycardia
Presented with episode of palpitations, persistent for about 20
minutes, more severe than two prior episodes over the past six
months. No associated symptoms. Rhythm strip from EMS per 
cardiology fellow demonstrated NCT with short RP retrograde P 
waves, consistent with likely AVNRT vs. AVRT. Repeat EKG without 
evidence of bypass track, making AVNRT more likely. Likely 
triggered in setting of diarrheal illness. Troponins x2 
negative. Long discussion had with patient; given asymptomatic 
and no red flag signs/angina at baseline, it was felt safe to 
discharge him with close follow-up. Recommend monitoring with 
ZioPatch to elucidate further the etiology of these episodes. If 
frequency increases, recommend up-titration of beta blocker vs. 
transition to calcium blocker, although patient reluctant to do 
same this admission. 

========================
CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
======================== 

# HFrEF (35% ___
Patient reported not having repeat echo since initial diagnosis 
in ___. Recommend repeat echo as an outpatient to determine 
need to optimize medical therapy further. No heart failure 
symptoms on history. 

# CAD with prior mLCx ___ transition to aspirin 81mg daily and continue atorvastatin 
80mg daily. 

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================

[ ] NCT: recommend outpatient follow-up with rhythm monitoring 
to capture one of these events (e.g. ZioPatch)
[ ] BETA-BLOCKER: if these episodes increase in frequency, would 
up-titrate metoprolol vs. transition to calcium channel blocker
[ ] HFrEF: recommend repeat echocardiogram as outpatient to 
determine need for optimization of heart failure regimen

___ 
IMPRESSION: Successful insertion of a new 16 ___ MIC feeding 
tube into 
pre-existing tract with tip in the jejunum. The tube is ready 
for use. 

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 4:48 ___ 
Tracheostomy tube appears appropriately positioned. Trace 
lucency outlines 
the aortic arch and descending aorta which may represent a trace 
amount of 
pneumomediastinum, to which attention should be paid on followup 
examination. 
The PICC line is again seen in unchanged position. No 
pneumothorax is 
appreciated. There is left perihilar haziness and increased 
opacity within 
the left hemithorax as well as at the right lung base which is 
not 
significantly changed and may reflect pulmonary edema, although 
a superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 

Portable TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 11:20:00 AM
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal 
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. There is abnormal systolic septal 
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure 
overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary 
artery hypertension with right ventricular pressure overload 
septal pattern. The normal right ventricular cavity size and 
free wall motion suggests that the pulmonary hypertension is 
chronic, though cannot exclude acute on chronic process.

History of Present Illness:
___ F with history of sarcoid, cardiomyopathy (baseline EF 20%) 
with mitral regurg s/p ___ transferred from ___ 
___ with respiratory failure. EMS called to patient's 
ophtho office after she became acutely short of breath in the 
waiting room, noted to be tripoding and cyanotic. Per her 
partner, she has been complaining of increased dyspnea on 
exertion and subjective palpitations for the past 3 weeks or so. 
He has been checking her pulse at home and it has been 
persistently in the ___. He does not think she has had fevers or 
chills or productive cough. Of note, ___ CT chest with upper 
lobe nodule but otherwise unremarkable.

EMS found her on the ground with frothy red sputum and HR <50. 
She was intubated in the field and send to ___, where CXR 
suggestive of pulmonary edema and EKG showed 100% ventricular 
pacing. WBC 12.8. She received 500cc NS, 60mg lasix, 1g 
ceftriaxone. She was started on norepinphrine in transit.

On arrival to the ___ ED, pressures were labile. Patient 
started on dopamine initially, then weaned off pressors. 
Subclavian line placed sterilely. CXR shows diffuse fluffy 
infiltrates suggestive of pulmonary edema. Bedside echo with 
underfilled RV, so she got 1L IVF. CTA without evidence of PE, 
but was suggestive of massive aspiration.
 
On arrival to the MICU, patient satting high ___ on 100% FIO2. 
On levophed. At 1700, became increasingly hypotensive, lost 
pulse. Rhythm not shockable. Chest compressions done, given 1mg 
epi x 2, with ROSC. At 1730, pressures dropped again, got 
additional 0.5mg epi. At 1745, had another PEA arrest, regained 
pulse after 1mg epi, 1 round chest compressions. Bedside echo by 
cards fellow showed RV is small, underfilled. small pericardial 
effusion, not big enough to intervene on. LVEF 20%, no real 
changes from previous, still inf/inflat hypokinesis/akinesis. 
abnormal septal motion, apical dyskinesis. MR is 1+, nothing to 
explain the picture. Given IV fluids with transient response.

___:
Deceased
Time of death:
No palpable pulse. Patient not breathing. Pupils fixed and 
dilated. No heart sounds.
 
Pertinent Results:
CXR ___: Moderate pulmonary edema.  Standard positioning of 
lines and tubes.

CT head non-con ___: No acute intracranial abnormality.  

CTA chest ___: PRELIM
1. No large central pulmonary embolism.  
2. Diffuse bilateral dependent consolidations concerning for 
massive aspiration and perihilar ground glass opacities which 
likely relate to 
superimposed pulmonary edema.  
3. Enlarged calcified hilar lymphadenopathy, consistent with 
patient's known  diagnosis of sarcoidosis.  

ECHO ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with 
extensive regional wall motion abnormalities including 
hypokinesis to akinesis of the basal to mid inferior, 
inferoseptal, and inferolateral walls. The mid anterior septum 
is hypokinetic and the distal septum and apex are dyskinetic. 
The remaining apical segments are severely hypokinetic/akinetic. 
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free 
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened 
(?#). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral 
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial 
effusion. No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. 

IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD versus infiltrative disease from 
patient's known sarcoid. At least moderate mitral regurgitation. 
This can be better assessed with TEE given shadowing seen on the 
current study. Small pericardial effusion without 2D 
echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Right ventricular 
cavity size is normal to borderline small with mild global 
hypokinesis. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
there is now a pericardial effusion. The right ventricular size 
is slightly smaller compared to prior study. RA pressure is 
indeterminate as patient is intubated, but these findings may 
suggest a degree of hypovolemia. Other findings appear similar 
(full comparison not possible given that this was a focused 
study).

EEG ___
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study 
because of 
diffuse suppression of background voltages and a discontinuous 
pattern with ___ second long periods of generalized suppression. 
This is consistent with a moderate to severe encephalopathy, 
which can be seen secondary to medications, toxins, infections 
or hypoxic-ischemic injury. There are no epileptiform discharges 
and no electrographic seizures.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with PMHx of CAD (s/p stent to LAD in ___ and CABGx2 
in ___, carotid stenosis (s/p stenting in ___, DM, HTN, HL 
presents after having an abnormal stress 2 days ago for pre-cath 
hydration and cardiac catheterization tomorrow.

# Coronary Artery Disease - On arrival to the floor, the patient 
denied any recent chest pain.   The patient received 
pre-catheterization hydration per protocol with normal saline 
and bicarbonate.  He also received mucomyst.  He was continued 
on his aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, and simvastatin.  On the 
morning following his admission, the patient underwent cardiac 
catheterization.  He had 2 drug eluting stents placed in his RCA 
(see above for further details).  His post-catheterization 
course was slightly complicated by hypertension, initially 
requiring a nitroglycerine drip.  His blood pressure decreased 
somewhat but still remained above goal.  At discharge, his 
amlodipine was uptitrated in an attempt to get better control of 
his blood pressure.

# Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure - The patient has a history of 
heart failure, with recent echo showing diastolic dysfunction 
with EF of 70%.  The patient did have significant ___ edema on 
exam; however, his lungs were clear.  His lasix were held during 
his pre-catheterization hydration.  After his catheterization 
procedure, he continued to receive hydration.  His creatinine 
was monitored.  After his hydration was complete, he was 
restarted on his home lasix regimen.

# DM - The patient was continued on his home regimen of Lantus 
and Humalog.  He was also continued on his home dose of 
amitriptyline for diabetic neuropathy.

# HTN - The patient was noted to be hypertensive on arrival to 
the floor.  He was continued on his home regimen of norvasc and 
metoprolol tartrate.  After catheterization, he did have some 
hypertension that initally required a nitroglycerine drip and 
later required a one-time dose of PO labetalol.  At discharge, 
the patient's blood pressures were still not at goal.  His 
amlodipine was uptitrated in an attempt to better control his 
blood pressure.

# Questionable Red Stools - On H&P, the patient reported a 
recent history of loose, red stools.  He did not have any stools 
while hospitalized to guaiac.  His hematocrit was monitored and 
was noted to decrease with hydration but to remain basically 
stable after that (36.1 -> 31.2 -> 29.2).  Iron studies were 
consistent with iron deficieny.  The reticulocyte count was not 
elevated.  Further work-up of this problem should be done as an 
outpatient.

# Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on his home regimen 
of simvastatin, zetia, and niacin.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o. M with dementia, CAD, CHF (unknonw EF), HTN, and history 
of falls, who presents s/p fall at nursing home with 
hypoglycemia.  

# Hypoglycemia. Patient noted to be severely hypoglycemic on 
labs in ED with finger stick of 29.  The etiology of 
hypoglycemia was thought to be secondary to malnutrition, 
especially with elevated INR of 1.5 in absence of other liver 
abnormalities.  As per nursing home, the patient has no history 
of diabetes and received no hypoglycemic medication in error.  
Infectious evaluation with urinalysis, chest x-ray was also 
negative.  Renal function was normal.  Insulin and c-peptide 
levels were low making a diagnosis of an insulinoma very 
unlikely. Prior to surgical fixation of left femur fracture, 
patient was NPO and maintained on a D51/2 NS drip.  Following 
ORIF, this was discontinued with the presumption that recurrent 
hypoglycemia could be avoided with adequate oral intake.  Blood 
glucose levels were checked every 4 hours and on ___ patient 
was noted to have ___ of 48, hypotension with SBP in ___, and 
periods of apnea.  Given 1 amp D50, fluid bolus of 750cc NS and 
1 UpRBC for ___ blood loss with normalization of 
vital signs and mental status returning to baseline.  Due to 
recurrent hypoglycemia, patient was maintained on glucose drip.  
Patient was noted to have dysphagia with poor oral intake and a 
speech/ swallow consultation recommended pureed diet with 
nectar-thickened liquids.  Despite dietary modification and 
nursing staff prompting, patient's oral intake did not improve 
and malnurishment was felt to be due to perioperative delerium 
with underlying advanced dementia.  The patient's daughter, his 
health care proxy, did not wish to pursue a PEG tube or other 
invasive methods to prolong life.  However, she agreed to 
temporizing methods to support patient through post-operative 
period to see if he would regain his desire to take in PO.  The 
patient was maintained on a D10 drip and, over the course of his 
hospitalization, he continued to have poor oral intake related 
to his advanced dementia. He was evaluated by the endocrinology 
service; given his low insulin levels and high 
beta-hydroxybutyrate level, it was felt that his persistent 
hypoglycemia was related to malnutrition and poor oral intake. 
After a lengthy meeting with the patient's daughter, it was 
decided, given the low likelihood that the patient would be able 
to progress back to the functional state he had been in the past 
and the fact that he was unable to support his own nutrition 
through PO intake, that the patient would be transitioned to 
comfort measures only. The D10 drip was stopped and 
non-essential medications were stopped. The patient passed away 
comfortably on ___.

# Hypoxia: Pt developed worsening hypoxia on ___. CXR showed 
new infiltrate. There was concern for aspiration, and the 
patient was started on cipro/flagyl. Additionally, the patient 
was grossly fluid overloaded from his continuous D10 drip. Of 
note, the patient did not spike any fevers nor did he develop a 
leukocytosis. Antibiotics were continued until the patient was 
made CMO. The patient was given lasix boluses in attempts to 
remove some fluid; however, his urine output did not respond 
very well.

# Left comminuted intertrochanteric femur fracture: Presented 
with left femur fracture after fall.  On ___, patient 
underwent uncomplicated ORIF of fracture.  Post-operatively, he 
was placed on enoxaparin to reduce risk of DVT formation.  For 
periprocedural blood loss, he was transfused 1 UpRBC and 
hematocrit stabilized at ___.   Initially pain was managed 
with acetaminophen around the clock and morphine as needed for 
breakthrough.  On ___, patient had a hypoglycemic episode with 
periods of observed apnea (see below), and as morphine may have 
been contributing to respiratory depression, it  was 
discontinued.  Breakthrough pain was managed with  oxycodone 
2.5mg as needed with good results.  He was maintained on vitamin 
D/ calcium through duration of hospital stay for underlying 
osteopenia/ osteoporosis.  Patient remained non-weight- bearing 
throughout hospital stay as per orthopedic recommendation.

# s/p Fall: As above, patient presented after an unwitnessed 
fall most likely mechanical +/- hypoglycemia.  ACS was ruled out 
with serially EKGs and flat cardiac enzymes x 3.  Patient was 
monitored on telemetry with no evidence of arrhythmia.  CT head 
showed no evidence of acute intracranial pathology that could 
have caused syncope.  As above, the fall resulted in a left 
femur fracture, managed by surgical fixation.   CT C-spine 
showed severe multilevel DJD with large posterior osteophytes 
and C3-4 predisposing to cord injury in the setting of trauma. 
Initially patient was placed in a ___ until C-spine was 
cleared by ortho.  No evidence of other mechanical injury 
resulting from fall.

#  CHF with unknown EF:  Volume status was monitored carefully 
throughout hospitalization especially in the setting of unknown 
ejection fraction, poor PO intake and continuous fluid 
requirements due to hypoglycemia.  Upon hospitalization, patient 
appeared hypovolemic and his furosemide was held pending 
surgery.   Through hospital course, patient became volume 
overloaded with pleural effusions on CXR and pitting edema in 
lower extremities.  Third spacing due to low oncotic pressure 
(albumin of 2.8) likely contributed.  Fluid overload managed 
with boluses of lasix 10mg IV prn to keep respiratory status 
stabilized.  Lisinopril and metoprolol were held in setting of 
low blood pressure. As above, the patient was given lasix in 
attempts to remove fluid; however, his urine output became less 
and less responsive. Ultimately, the patient was made CMO and 
passed away.

# Normocytic anemia: admitted with Hct around 35. Required 1U 
pRBC following surgery.  Hct was trended through hospitalization 
and remained stable.

#  Psych: Initially continued sertraline, risperidone, depakote 
for unknown mood d/o. Sertraline was ultimately d/c'ed out of 
concern that it could contribute to hypoglycemia; however, 
hypoglycemia did not improve after sertraline was stopped.

Imaging
CXR ___:

Impression: The current study demonstrates biventricular pacing 
devices with the leads most likely located in the right atrium, 
right ventricle and the left epicardial vein in expected 
location. Cardiomegaly is moderate to severe, unchanged. 
Mediastinum is unremarkable. No pneumothorax is seen. Small 
amount of pleural effusion is noted most likely on the right. 

ECG ___: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. 
Left bundle-branch block with a single narrowly conducted QRS 
complex. The axis is right inferior. Since previous tracing the 
single narrow complex beat is new. Despite a more rapid 
ventricular response, the axis is the same. One should verify 
that the limb leads were properly placed. Clinical correlation 
is suggested.
. 
Chest X-ray ___:
FINDINGS: The heart size is enlarged, apparently slightly 
increased from
prior study, this maybe the magnifying effect of AP projection. 
The
mediastinal contours again demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic 
disease of the aortic knob. Cephalization of pulmonary 
vasculature is accompanied by interstitial edema. The lungs 
demonstrate airspace opacity in the right
infrahilar region. Additionally, subtle blunting of the 
bilateral
costophrenic angles persist, compatible with small pleural 
effusions. Thereis no pneumothorax.
 
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with interstitial edema; right 
infrahilar airspace
opacity may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, but follow up 
radiographs may be helpful to exclude pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F with PMH of nonischemic cardiomyopathy 
(EF 25% on ___, HTN, mitral valve prolapse, intermittent 
LBBB, and atrial fibrillation who was admitted for progressively 
worsening SOB for the over 3 days secondary to CHF exacerbation. 

. 
# Cardiac arrest: on ___, patient was successfully cardioverted 
to normal sinus rhythem. She was given a dose of dofetilide. 
Later that day it was noted that her QTc was elongated from 
previously. That evening, she had a cardiac arrest secondary to 
torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation. She was 
defibrillated after 60 seconds and had ROSC and regained 
consciousness. She was briefly transferred to the CCU, where her 
magnesium and potassium were repleted and serial EKGs showed 
decreasing QTc interval. 

# Acute on chronic CHF:  Patient reported history of dyspnea on 
exertion, orthopnea, PND and new onset ankle swelling.  Has 
known history of CHF with EF 25% in ___. After receiving 
Lasix 40mg IV in the ER, she put out 800cc and dyspnea resolved. 
 Initial history and exam consistent with a CHF exacerbation.  
___ have baseline worsening EF as she has had such symptoms for 
approximately 2 weeks which improved with Lasix.  ___ be 
secondary to worsening EF in combination with afib with RVR.  
Patient's beta blocker was changed on ___ but she has been 
self titrating the medication and not receiving enough beta 
blockade.  (Was on Metoprolol XL 100, this was d/c'ed on 
___ and started on Carvedilol 6.25 mg bid.  Instead, taking 
Metoprolol 50 daily and Carvedilol 3.125 daily.) Therefore, her 
rate was not well controlled which is likely stressing the heart 
by decreasing adequate forward flow.  Initially, changed to 
carvedilol for rate control.  On ___, carvedilol switched to 
metoprolol and rate better controlled. Her metoprolol dose was 
adjusted again secondary to her Afib and changed up to metop 
150XL. .Patient was optimized on an oral regimen of Lasix prior 
to discharge and remained euvolemic. Patient to receive 20meqK 
replacement on discharge as well to supplement lasix.
.
# Paroxysmal A-fib/RHYTHM: Patient with known history of atrial 
fibrillation.  Rate not well controlled on Carvedilol and 
digoxin.  Patient was instead started on metoprolol with much 
better rate control.  Just started on Coumadin 5mg qd 5 days 
prior to admission. Patient continued anticoagulation with 
coumadin throughout stay (dosage adjustments made per INR). ___ 
had TEE with cardiovesion ___, initiall successful then patient 
developed torsades in the afternoon which responded to 
magnesium. Shortly thereafter patient coded with Vfib, with CPR 
performed for 1 minute, received one shock and had ROSC. Pt had 
continuous Mg replacement. Pt was then brought back to the floor 
in stable condition. She continued to be in Afib and had an 
increase in her metoprolol dose for rate control. Patient was 
then started  Amio gtt and load. She had inital attempt at BIV 
ICD placement for LBBB on ___ which was unsuccessful. The 
following day patient had repeat procedure and successful BIV 
ICD placement. Patient remained in Afib s/p procedure, and 
continued her anticoagulation, and will continue PO amio and 
metoprolol for control. Warfarin dose decreased from 6 to 5 
prior to discharge due to supratherapuetic INR 3.1. She is to 
follow up with Dr. ___ the next 2 weeks, and device 
clinic on ___ for evaluation of pacemaker. Pt also will 
complete 6 day course of Keflex for pacemaker placement. 

  
# CORONARIES: No history of CAD.  LDL was 147 in ___.  She is 
not on a statin because she has function limiting myalgias as a 
side effect. Pt started on ASA 81 during hospitilazation and to 
continue as outpatient. 
.
.  
# Hyponatremia: Patient was hyponatremic at 129 on admission, Na 
was lowest at 126.  Baseline in last several years (several data 
points) has been in the mid to low 130s. Patient was 
asymptomatic, mentating well.  ___ have been secondary to 
combination of diuretics as well as CHF exacerbation leading to 
intravascular depletion and ADH secretion.  Na improved with 1.5 
L fluid and free water restriction and stabilized. Her Na 
returned back to her baseline upon discharge, she is to follow 
up with this in clinic.
  
# Rash: Patient with new macular rash as of morning of admission 
on lower abdomen, lower back and breasts.  Denied any new 
lotions, detergents.  Did take melatonin day prior to admission 
for the first time.  After examination rash appeared to be 
fungal in etiology, most c/w with intertrigo. Patient placed on 
topical miconazole with improvement in rash.

Studies:
___ TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal. The aortic valve is not well 
seen. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 
1.0-1.2cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be 
determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate aortic valve 
stenosis. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and low normal global systolic function. 
.
___ EKG:
Sinus tachycardia. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the 
previous
tracing no change.
___
___
.
___ CXR PA/Lat:
FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is hyperexpansion of the 
lungs with
flattening of the hemidiaphragms consistent with the clinical 
diagnosis of
chronic pulmonary disease.  Enlargement of the cardiac 
silhouette is seen. 
Mild prominence of interstitial markings could reflect elevated 
pulmonary
venous pressure, chronic lung disease, or both.
 
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
.
___ CTA:
1.  There is no pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2.  Main pulmonary artery 3.5 cm across, suggests pulmonary 
artery
hypertension.
3.  Aortic valve is heavily calcified, could be hemodynamically 
significant.  
4.  Right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis is very 
mild.
5.  A cluster of right hilar lymph nodes measuring 24 x 6 mm is 
marginates the right upper lobe bronchus and should be followed 
up with a chest CT in three months.
6.  Mild splenomegaly measuring 15.2 cm
.
___ TTE w/contrasted saline:
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, 
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
.
___ Stress portion of MIBI study:
This ___ yo with a PMH of HTN, HLD, and moderate AS
(valve area 1.2 cm2) was referred to the lab from the inpatient 
cardiac
service for evaluation of several months of exertional dyspnea
?CHF/dCHF. The patient was brought to the lab after IV diuresis 
and
negative cardiac enzymes. He exercised for 9 minutes on a 
Gervino
protocol and stopped for fatigue and shortness of breath. The 
estimated
peak MET capacity was 4.8 which represents a poor exercise 
tolerance for
his age. The patient denied any arm, neck, back, or chest 
discomfort
throughout the procedure. At peak exercise he did note 
progressive
dyspnea but felt that it was appropriate for the workload 
achieved and
not nearly as severe as his symptoms were prior to this hospital
admission. There were no significant ST segment changes from 
baseline
seen during exercise or recovery. The rhythm was sinus with 
occasional
isolated VPBs. Appropriate HR response to exercise. Blunted BP 
response
to exercise.
IMPRESSION: Atypical/Mild progressive dyspnea in the absence of
significant ST segment changes from baseline. Poor exercise 
tolerance.
Blunted BP response to exercise. Nuclear report sent separately.
.
___ Nuclear portion of MIBI study:
1.  Fixed inferior wall defect.
2.  No reversible perfusion defects.  
3.  Diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with the hypokinesis 
most pronounced in
the basal portion of the inferior wall. 
4.  Dilated left ventricle.  
5.  Decreased ejection fraction of 30%.  
.
___ R and L heart catheterization:
1.Single vessel CAD with occluded proximal RCA (CTO) consistent
with the nuclear perfusion study findings
2.Severe aortic valve stenosis with mean gradient 55 mmHg by
invasive assessment and calculated ___ of 0.7 cm2.
3.Moderately elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures,
moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension
4.Anomalous LCX originating from a large RI trunk
5.Reviewed with Drs. ___. Plans for OHS with AVR 
and
___  
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o man with PMHx of HTN, HLD, and no known CAD that 
presented with several week h/o of worsening DOE. Initially 
thought to represent ___ exacerbation, as he was volume 
overloaded and had SBP in 170's with preserved EF on initial 
TTE. Diuresed to dry weight with resolution of symptoms. 
Underwent further screening tests, including stress MIBI and 
repeat TTE. Reevaluation of heart function with MIBI 
demonstrated depressed EF (30%). Eventually underwent r. and l. 
heart catheterization which demonstrated single vessel CAD and 
severe AS. Evaluated by cardiac surg for aortic valve 
replacement vs. repair and potential SVG to RCA. Rather than 
stay in-house prior to surgery, he opted to go home and discuss 
options with family.     
.
#Severe AS: He presented with worsening DOE that was initially 
thought related to ___ rather than underlying valvular disease, 
as his EF was preserved on intitial TTE. Same study documented 
only moderate AS. Eventually underwent r. and l. heart 
catheterization which demonstrated an ___ of 0.77cm. As pt has 
symptoms of heart failure and reduced EF (see below), he is a 
candidate for AVR. Of note, no history of angina or syncope. Pt 
was amenable to valve replacement, but did not wish to have 
work-up done as inpatient. He prefers to go home and talk over 
with his family. Started on CHF meds (see below). Avoided 
overdiuresis given his pre-load dependence.
.
#Acute sCHF exacerbation: Pt came in with worsening DOE and 
lower extremity swelling. He had difficulty making it from 
clinic to the hospital ___ symptoms. CTA was performed to rule 
out PE. No PE was noted. He was diuresed with IV lasix, and DOE 
resolved. It is unclear whether initial presentation was ___ 
___ vs ___ as initial echo documented low normal LVEF and mild 
LVH. The images were noted to be suboptimal. Had stress MIBI 
with calulated EF of 30%. Despite discordant echo results 
showing preserved EF, it appeared that depressed EF (~30%) on 
stress MIBI was more compatible with clinical picture. Started 
on ___ (cough with ACE-I), toprol xL and maintenance diuretic 
prior to discharge.
.
#CAD: No known cardiac disease prior to admission. Pt with total 
occlusion of proximal RCA with good collateral flow. Likely a 
candidate for bypass surgery. No h/o angina or anginal 
equivalent. Started on atorvastatin and toprol xL. 
.
# Elevated ESR/CRP: Initial ESR/CRP elevated. Thought to be ___ 
recent upper respiratory infection.  
.
# Elevated Lactate: Resolved on admission. No localizing s/sx 
other than cough and SOB. Possibly related to mild hypoxia with 
URI. 
.
# Fever/Leukocytosis: Initially presented with low grade fever 
and leukocytosis, which resolved during admission. Likely 
related to viral URI. Blood and urine cx negative
.
Chronic Issues:
#HTN: Pt was hypertensive on admission, which normalized with 
amlodipine. While his amlodipine was continued at discharge, he 
will likely benefit from stopping this med, as he has newly 
diagnosed sCHF.
.
Transitional Issues:
#Will need repeat CT in 3 months to evaluate r. hilar 
lymphadenopathy
#Will need lytes check in 1 week after starting ___ 
#Consider d/c'ing amlodipine in setting of new ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted with shortness of breath. We 
gave you intravenous diuretics and your breathing improved. You 
then had a nulcear stress test, which showed decreased pump 
function of your heart and findings concerning for a coronary 
artery blockage. You then went for a cardiac catheterization for 
further investigation which showed a complete blockage of one of 
your arteries (right coronary artery). The catheterization also 
showed that you had severe stenosis of your aortic valve. You 
were evaluated by the cardiac surgeons for consideration of 
valve replacement and coronary artery bypass. You will follow up 
with the cardiac surgeons as an outpatient. 

You will also follow up with a cardiologist as an outpatient. 
Your new cardiolgist is Dr. ___ who you will meet her on 
___.

You will need to weigh yourself everyday. If you notice that 
your weight is up more than 3 pounds in one day please call your 
primary care doctor for further instruction. 

You will need to have your blood work checked the day of your 
appointment on ___.

Please note the following changes to your medications:
START Lasix 20mg daily
START Losartan 25mg daily
START Metoprolol Succinate 12.5mg daily

Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ male with h/o melanoma metastatic to lung and brain who 
presents with worsening shortness of breath. He has had a 
melanoma and ___ cell cancer resected in the past. he was 
found to have lung lesion in ___, this was resected in ___ and found to be melanoma. ___ developed pleural 
effusion and was seen at ___ in ___ and had 
thoracentesis. In ___ had PET scan showing progression of 
disease in multiple spots, including brain for which he had 
cyberknife. He had f/u imaging ___ which shows new brain 
lesions and progression of other lesions around his body. He was 
planning on starting ipilimumab soon. 
___ days ago the patient first started noticing shortness of 
breath, initially with walking, then with most activities. 
around the same time he reduced his lasix dose to half because 
he was having to get up frequently at night to urinate. He was 
taking the whole 40mg lasix dose in the morning. He has noticed 
since then that he doesn't have to get up at night anymore. He 
denies any previous history of lung problems other than the 
pleural effusion. He has no fever/chills and only minimal dry 
cough. His wife thinks he felt a bit warm. He has not had a cold 
lately. He has some leg edema but thinks it is better after 
stopping decadron. He has been raising the head of his bed 
because he can breath better that way. He has decreased 
appetite. He does not have n/v or diarrhea. he has no rash but 
has some skin lesions he thinks might be melanoma. 
He came to clinic today and was found to have o2 sats in the mid 
___ when ambulating. He was started on nasal cannula oxygen with 
improvement. Exam and CXR were consistent with pulmonary edema 
and he was admitted for diuresis.
 
Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
-- ___:  Noticed a lesion at the top of his right scalp.  
Biopsy
showed a ___ level IV melanoma.
-- ___:  Wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy
in ___.  Two sentinel lymph nodes were negative for disease. 

Mr. ___ received radiation therapy to the area and was put on
an active surveillance program.
-- ___:  Developed another lesion on his scalp.  This was
again biopsied and found to be ___ cell carcinoma.  This 
was
completely excised and treated with adjuvant radiation therapy.
-- ___:  PET showed a mass in the right lung and a mass in
the left adrenal gland.  Right lung lesion had an SUV of 40 and
the adrenal lesion had an SUV of 6.  He was referred to a
thoracic surgeon.
-- ___: Underwent a right lower lobectomy.  Pathology was
consistent with metastatic melanoma.
-- ___: Presented to urgent care with SOB. He was found 
to
have a right pleural effusion on chest x-ray and was referred to
the ___ Emergency Department.  He had a 
thoracentesis
in the ED. He recalls 750 mL of fluid being drained. 
-- PET ___ showed overall marked progression of disease from
the prior study. There is a brain metastasis in the right
temporal lobe. Non-avid moderate pleural effusion and
several new FDG-avid pulmonary nodules bilaterally and left 
hilar lymphadenopathy.  There are scattered soft tissue nodules
throughout the chest. The left adrenal metastasis has grown in
size. There is new metastatic disease in the pancreas, gastric
wall, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, perinephric fat and anterior
abdominal wall. Two foci of uptake in the right acetabulum and
femoral neck, although without CT correlate, is suspicious for
new metastatic disease. 
-- ___: MRI head right frontal and temporal enhancing 
masses
with surrounding edema suggesting metastatic disease.
Apparently extra-axial dural-based faintly enhancing lesion
adjacent to the left occipital lobe.  This may represent a
dural-based metastasis or a meningioma.

PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
HISTORY:  ___ man with melanoma.  Evaluate effusion.
IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
Patient has chronic thickening of the pleural margins of both 
lungs. 
Comparing today's study with the most recent prior chest imaging 
examination,
a chest CT on ___, the widespread ground-glass 
abnormality appears to
have progressed.  Since there is also increase in mediastinal 
vascular
caliber, specifically the azygos vein, and heart size, I suspect 
this is
mostly due to pulmonary edema.  There is also suggestion of new 
consolidation
in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, which could be 
pneumonia,
but I am hesitant to make that assessment given the radiographic 
complexity of
the chest given the extensive pleural abnormality.  In the 
future, it would be
reasonable to obtain chest radiographs concurrently with CT 
scans so that both
are available to serve as baseline for subsequent imaging 
followup.

Bilateral lower extremity doppler US ___
IMPRESSION:  No deep venous thrombosis in the bilateral lower 
extremity veins.

CT chest ___
IMPRESSION:
1  Unchanged metastatic nodules in the lungs bilaterally.
2. Increase in opacities throughout the lungs, right greater 
than left, along
with increase in moderate right pleural effusion likely 
represents pulmonary
edema.  Underlying infection cannot be entirely ruled out.  
3. Unchanged dilation of main pulmonary artery likely 
representing pulmonary
hypertension.

Echocardiogram ___
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function 
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Doppler parameters are 
indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free 
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened 
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be 
underestimated. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity 
is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. 
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global systolic function. Borderline right ventricular 
systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral 
regurgitation. At least moderate tricuspid regurgitation. 
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.  

CXR ___
FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST:  Compared to ___, bilateral 
parenchymal
opacities have significantly improved.  Moderate bilateral 
pleural effusions
persist.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal 
silhouettes are
stable. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with metastatic melanoma admitted for worsening 
shortness of breath refractory to medical therapy and now 
transitioned to comfort measures.

# Dyspnea: Patient was initially admitted to the FICU with acute 
dyspnea and hypoxia. Initially treated for CHF due to imaging 
suggestive of volume overload, elevated BNP to 8300 and history 
of decreased lasix dose several days prior to admission. He was 
started on diuresis with IV lasix, TTE without significant 
abnormality. Over the first several days of admission, he was in 
negative fluid balance and lost about ___ of fluid however 
without improvement in subjective symptoms or objective 
findings. Records from thoracic surgeon in ___ revealed a 
granuloma resected in ___ which eventually grew MAC. Due to 
lack of improvement he was treated for HCAP with Vanc/Cefepime 
and Levoflxacin and Bactrim for PJP. Several sputum samples 
including induced sputum were sent, but all had oral 
contamination, bronchoscopy was too high risk so was deferred. 
O2 sats continued to worsen eventually requiring ___ via 
nonrebreather mask to maintain o2 sats >90%. The patient had 
previously stated his wishes not to be intubated. He was 
maintained on nonrebreather but unable to be weaned. Hypoxia 
thought related to extensive metastatic disease of his lungs and 
family meeting was held. Decision made that patient preferred 
comfort over further invasive procedure or invasive ventilation. 
He was transitioned to PRN dilaudid and PRN ativan. 
   
# CMO: On ___ the patient remained on high flow nasal cannula 
and face tent. He appeared comfortable and without air hunger. 
Family at bedside happy with care provided and comfortable with 
his level of comfort. He continued to decline and became 
non-interactive and non-verbal. Supportive therapy with 
Morphine, Dilaudid, Lorazepam and Scopolamine patch. On ___ 
patient passed away comfortably with family at bedside. Autopsy 
was declined.

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed woman with a history of 
Afib on Coumadin, anxiety and depression who presents after 
being found lethargic in her room this morning.  According to 
her daughter, she spoke to her mother last night around 7:30pm, 
at which point she had no complaints, and sounded to be at her
baseline.  The patient reports that she remembers getting ready 
for, and going to bed, however, is not quite sure what happened 
after that.  While she normally is very prompt about going to 
breakfast, this morning she was not seen at breakfast, so her 
facility sent someone to check on her around 9am.  They found 
her still in bed, slightly confused.  She was taken to ___ where 
she was found to have a R cerebellar and L occipital infarct, in 
the context of an INR of 1.3.  She underwent an MRI which showed 
a small area of hemorrhagic conversion of the cerebellar 
infarct, at which point she was transferred to ___.

CT HEAD:  Similar right cerebellar infarction with hemorrhagic 
conversion and mass effect on the fourth ventricle. Similar left 
occipital infarction. 

TTE: No cardiac source of embolism seen. Normal global and 
regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation. Biatrial dilatation. Bubble study not performed 
due to patient's advanced age (even if PFO/ASD found, source of 
embolism is more likely to be atrial fibrillation).  

CT head (___): Essentially unchanged evolving right cerebellar 
and left occipital infarcts with hemorrhagic transformation. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is an ___ year-old right-handed woman with a history of 
HTN, Afib and mitral regurgitation presenting after being found 
lethargic and slightly confused

Neuro: On imaging at OSH, she was found to have a right 
cerebellar and left occipital infarct. Her exam is notable for 
dysarthria as well as right sided dysmetria and overshoot. She 
has atrial fibrillation, for which she is on Coumadin, but INR 
was subtherapeutic, making atrial fibrillation the most likely 
etiology of her current infarct.  Given the small amount of 
hemorrhagic conversion, the Coumadin was initially held, but has 
since been restarted; however, there was no briding with heparin 
gtt. Regarding risk factors, she had HbA1C, which was normal at 
5.8 and Lipid Panel, which showed LDL 116. TTE was performed and 
did now show a cardiac source of embolism and there was normal 
systolic function.  A repeat CT head was performed on ___, 
which showed no progression in terms of edema or hemorrhagic 
conversion. 

___: Was having tachypnea on her first night of admission, 
likely due to not receiving her lasix dosing earlier in the day. 
Her CXR showed diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema with newly 
developed bilateral pleural effusions. She was given lasix with 
good response in regards to her respiratory rate. Her CXR was 
unchanged on two repeat studies. She did become hypotensive with 
the lasix, so she received IVF and the dosing of the lasix as 
well as some of her anti-HTN were reduced. After these changes 
were made, she remained hemodynamically stable. After being 
hemodynamically stable for 48 hours, her BP meds were adjusted 
to start her back slowly on her home meds. We do not wish to 
return to all her BP meds at discharge to prevent further 
hypotensive episodes; however, if she remains with elevated BPs, 
they can be restarted while at rehab. Her Imdur and Norvasc 
continue to be held and her Lisinopril and Clonodine not at her 
full home dose. 

Psych: she was initially very agitated and was sundowning; 
Seroquel prn was used with good effect. However, she has not 
needed this since ___. We will keep it on her discharge 
medication list in case she begins to sundown again initially in 
a new facility.

Atrial fibrillation

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).
Neuro defecits: mildly dysarthric speech, right eye ptosis (old,

ataxia. 

 
Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital after being found lethargic and 
slightly confused in your room. Imaging of your head showed an 
acute stroke in the left occipital lobe and in the right 
cerebellum. The stroke in the cerebellium is resulting in your 
difficulty with coordination with the right side of your body. 
The strokes are likely from clots from your heart and due to 
your Coumadin level being too low. The Coumadin was initially 
held because you had some bleeding into one of the new strokes, 
but it was later determined to be safe to restart this to reduce 
future stroke risk, so it has been restarted. You have remained 
stable since the Coumadin was restarted.

Chief Complaint:
Increasing edema, chest pain

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

 
History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo M w/ a PMH of recent gunshot wound w/ extensive 
chest / cardiac damage and TV replacement w/ a complicated 
post-op course and recent VATS intrapleural pneumolysis for 
right sided empyema who presents w/ approx two weeks of dyspnea, 
increasing ___ edema and pleuritic chest pain. 

He was hospitalized at ___ in ___ following a gunshot 
wound. His post-operative course was complicated by atrial 
fibrillation, reintubation for respiratory distress, left side 
pleural effusion requiring chest tube placement, ___ with 
hyponatremia, and serratia bacteremia, stenotrophomonas and 
enterobacter pneumonia as well as C.Diff colitis for which he 
completed a course of vanc, fagyl, cefepime and bactrim. He was 
transferred to a rehab hospital on ___ and since that time 
he had been recovering well, his transaminitis and ___ have been 
improving, until ___ when he was noted to be having a 
leukocytosis of 16 ___s low grade fevers. C.diff was 
checked and noted to be positive so PO vancomycin was started. 
He was also started on IV vancomycin and meropenem out of 
concern for systemic infection in the setting of his prosthetic 
tricuspid valve. A CT of the thorax was obtained and found  
persistent bilateral effusions. The left effusion had air 
pockets that were not seen on a prior CT from ___ which was 
concerning for empyema. Per report the CT scan also shows an 
area of large bowel that is consistent with colitis likely 
secondary to his c.diff infection. Blood culture data was only 
significant for ___ bottles coag neg staph, subsequent bottles 
were negative, this was likely a contaminant. PICC line was 
placed on ___ for difficult IV access. For treatment of the 
empyema he underwent VATS intrapleural pneumolysis and 
decortication on ___. He was subsequently discharged to a 
rehab facility.

Over the several weeks he has been having progressive dyspnea on 
exertion, sharp pleuritic chest pain radiating to the back, and 
increasing lower extremity edema. pleuritic chest pain radiating 
to theback, and lower extremity edema. He is also reporting 
chest pain, which is worse when palpated, to the left of his 
sternum below the nipple. He was seen by Cardiothoracic surgery 
yesterday in follow up clinic and subsequently admitted due to 
concern for heart failure. An echo demonstrated a moderately 
dilated LA and RA w/ an EF of 60%, hypertrophied right free wall 
w/ normal RV chamber sizes and depressed free wall activity. 
Higher than expected gradients for the trisucpid prosthesis were 
noted. An EKG was notable for RVH and RBBB, without ST or T wave 
abnormalities concerning for acute ischemia. He is currently 
being diuresed with Lasix.

Studies:
___ CXR PA/Lat:  No major interval changes.  Observe that 
the next preceding examination was already a study four days 
following the empyema surgery. All drainage tubes have been 
removed from the left hemithorax already at that time. 
.
___ TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right 
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). The 
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. 
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened 
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation 
is seen. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate 
(___) mitral regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic tricuspid 
valve is present. The gradients (7 mmHg at minimum; spectral 
Doppler measurements taken non-coaxially)) are higher than 
expected for this type of prosthesis. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  
.
___ CXR PA/Lat:
Mild cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable. Moderate 
bilateral 
pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis have increased on 
the left.  Fluid in the right fissure is again noted. Right mid 
lung atelectases are unchanged. There is no evident 
pneumothorax. Sternal wires are aligned.  Healed fracture in the 
third right rib is again noted. 
.
___ RUQ U/S:
1. 2.4 cm avascular heterogeneous but predominantly hyperechoic 
lesion within hepatic segment VIII at site of prior laceration 
likely reflects resolving hematoma. 
2. Hepatopetal portal venous flow with increased phasicity 
likely related to congestive heart failure.   
3. Coarse liver texture.  When considered in conjunction with 
prior CT, 
findings are concerning for cirrhosis. No ascites. 
4. Galbladder wall thickening, without gallbladder distention. 
Likley related to liver disease or secondarily to CHF. 
.
___ CXR: 
Near resolution of interstitial edema. Persistent pleural 
effusions and multifocal atelectasis. 
.
___ R and L sided heart Cath: 
     1.Patent coronary arteries
     2.Normal filling pressures, cardiac output and cardiac 
        index
     3.No step-up or step-down in O2 saturation
     4.Brief episode of AFib with RVR treated with BB and 
        eventually reverted to sinus rhythm

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with PMHx of GSW to the chest resulting in multiple 
thoracic and abdominal injuries including tricuspid valve damage 
s/p TVR, RV free wall and septum perforation s/p repair. 
Presented with new onset R sided heart failure. Initially 
thought to be secondary to small TV replacement, however, after 
large volume diuresis, HD parameters normalized and TV gradient 
<4mm hg. Discharged home with PO lasix and instructed to engage 
in low salt diet.
.
Active Issues
# Acute decompensated CHF: Pt presented with clinical e/o both R 
and L sided CHF including 3+ BLE to knees, JVD, and crackles. 
Given recent TVR, thought that he may have an undersized valve 
along with decreased RV systolic function ___ GSW. LVEF was 
normal on initial echo, but TTE with mild/moderate MR, which may 
be contributing to his pulmonary edema. Placed on fluid and Na 
restriction, with daily weights and I/Os. Started on lasix gtt 
at 10cc/hr, and diuresed until edema resolved. This resulted in 
resolution of all symptoms. All electrolytes were agressively 
repleted. Pt underwent cardiac catheterization which showed no 
CAD, step-up or step-downs in O2, and normal filling pressures. 
Echo after diuresis did not demonstrate significant gradient 
across tricuspid valve replacement, so patient was discharged 
home on PO diuretics and instructed to keep to low soduium diet. 
Unclear of exact etiology of exacerbation. 
.
# Abd Pain: Pt presented with RUQ abdominal pain. This was 
likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy, as it resolved with 
diuresis. RUQ U/S showed findings concerning for cirrhsis, which 
will likely need to be followed up as outpatient. Transaminases 
WNL. 
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: A-fib occurred ___, during 
last admission so patient was started on amiodarone for rhythm 
control. When he was admitted this time, he was in NSR. Given 
significant SEs of amio, this was stopped. Developed several 
episodes of paroxysmal a. fib in-house. Because of this, he was 
started on PO coumadin (CHADS=2) and metoprolol for rate 
control.
.
Chronic Issues
#HTN: H/o HTN. Controlled on home meds.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you at the ___ 
___. You were admitted for congestive heart failure. 
We gave you medications to remove the excess fluid from your 
body. We also performed a cardiac catheterization that showed 
the pressure in your heart is largely normal after the fluid 
removal. Your heart failure may be due to scar in the tissue 
around your heart from your gun shot wound. It will be very 
important to minimize the amount of fluid and salt you eat to 
avoid fluid buildup. 

While you were here, you developed atrial fibrillation, which is 
an abnormal heart rhythm that can lead to blood clots. For this, 
we started you on a new medication called Coumadin that prevents 
blood clots; it is very important that you have a blood test 
called INR performed on ___ by your PCP, ___, to 
make sure the level of Coumadin is correct for you. 

Weigh yourself every day. If your weight increases by more than 
3 lbs please call your Cardiologist. 

Please note the following changes to your medicaitons: 
STARTED Metoprolol
STARTED Imdur
STARTED Lisinopril
STARTED Coumadin
STARTED Torsemide
STOPPED Amiodarone
STOPPED Furosemide

# Cholangitis:
# Choledocholithiasis:
She had evidence of cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. She had 
improving pain (not fully resolved at the time of discharge; 
however was improving), resolved nausea and vomiting. She was 
placed on cipro and flagyl for 7 day course total (following 
PTBD). She will need a CCY which she wishes to pursue closer to 
home (will need to be arranged by PCP). She will follow up with 
___ for further management of her drains. In addition, she will 
need repeat LFTs to ensure resolution of transaminitis. She was 
discharge with a limited number of oxycodone for pain, mostly at

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with abdominal pain. This was due to a 
blockage in your bile duct. The GI team attempted ERCP but were 
unable to complete. You underwent interventional radiology 
procedure with removal of stone, and placement of drains (both 
internal and external drains). These were working well and your 
tests improved. You will have 4 more days of antibiotics 
(cirpofloxacin and flagyl). In addition, you will need to follow 
up with interventional radiology for further management of your 
drains. The interventional radiology team will contact you to 
arrange for follow up. Finally, you need to have your 
gallbladder removed. This can be done near your home. Please 
arrange this with your PCP. 

Of note, if you develop worsening pain, fevers, confusion or 
other worrisome symptoms please present to an emergency 
department. If you develop these symptoms you should uncap your 
external drain and connect to a bag.

You were prescribed oxycodone for pain. This pain shoudl improve 
over the next couple of weeks. You were discharged with 
oxycodone. If your pain is worsening or not resolving please 
discuss with PCP or present to ED. Of note, this medication will 
make you tired. Do not drive or drink alcohol while on this 
medication.

History of Present Illness:
___ yo F w/ DM2 and COPD who presented for planned left partial 
nephrectomy, then transferred to ICU post op d/t hypotension and 
respiratory distress.

Found to have an incidental left 3.2 cm complex renal cyst on CT 
abdomen (done to further investigate a right-sided abdominal 
hernia). In ___ Had an MRI that should an unchanged mass, and 
CT in ___ showed unchanged left renal mass along with a 
fusiform infrarenal AAA 3 cm. In ___, she had an ultrasound, 
which showed the renal mass at 3.3cm with question of possible 
new extension into the renal sinus fat and by ___ CT scan 
showed the left renal mass slightly enlarged at 3.5cm, which was

received 1750cc LR with UOP 150cc. However, there was difficulty 
in weaning the neo as her SBP would dip down to ___ off of 
it, from ___ on it. She was given a 500cc bolus and started 
on 150cc/hr IVF. It was felt that her respiratory status was 
stable, but per report her O2 sats were noted to go down to the 
___ on 4L when sleeping. During the procedure, she received 1mg 
midazolam, 100mg propofol, 4mg IV morphine, 100mcg fentanyl and 
2g cefazolin.

On arrival to the FICU, pt is somnolent but easily arousable and 
oriented. She is having slight discomfort at her left side where 
the incision is. Otherwise, denies chest pain or difficulty 
breathing. Additionally, she is complaining of peripheral 
neuropathy pain at bilateral feet R > L from the ankles down 
with heaviness of her feet.  

Of note, she had an admission in ___, during which she had a 
laminectomy and on POD#4, was noted to have SBPs in 70-90s 
without tachycardia. It was thought that her hypotension was 
likely related mostly to narcotics and she received narcan x1 
with good effect. She had a brief stay in teh MICU and BPs 
normalized, though it is unclear if pressors were needed.

IMAGING:
___ US INTRA-OP ___ MINS: Intra-operative guidance was 
provided for localization of the approximately 2.5 x 3.5 cm 
solid mass left kidney lateral aspect, having an exophytic 
component.  The lesion does not extend to the hilum.  Ultrasound 
helped confirm the margins of the tumor.  Service time was 30 
minutes. 

CT CHEST:
CONCLUSION: 
  
1.  Diffuse upper lung predominant interstitial opacities around 
severe 
emphysema are accompanied by new moderate bilateral pleural 
effusions.  The simplest explanation for those opacities would 
be interstitial cardiogenic or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema 
rather than infection.  Drug reaction is also a possibility. 
2.  Reactive central lymph nodes. 
3.  Significant dependant and passive lower lobe atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to Urology after undergoing 
laparoscopic LEFT partial nephrectomy. No concerning 
intra-operative events occurred; please see dictated operative 
note for details.  The patient received perioperative antibiotic 
prophylaxis. 

FICU COURSE:
Post Urologic surgery patient transferred to FICU d/t 
hypotension and requirement for pressors. Patient was on Neo, 
which was quickly weaned in <24 hours. Etiology likely d/t 
significant sensitivity to opioids and anesthesia (as documented 
on prior admissions). We avoided all opioids for remainder of 
her stay, instead used Tramadol and Toradol for pain control.  
Subsequently, while in the ___ patient developed worsening 
hypoxemic, hypercarbic respiratory distress. She has a long COPD 
history with long smoking history. Initialy CXR's suggested both 
volume overload and RUL + LLL infiltrates so patient was started 
on HCAP coverage and aggressive diuresis. Patient was maintained 
net negative daily, at least 1L with prn IV Lasix. CXR and 
respiratory status continued to worsen and ARDS was suspected so 
pt was eventually intubated. Pt was further diuresed during 
intubation, then extubated in about 18 hours. Post extubation 
patient's respiratory status was tenuous so a CT Chest was 
checked that should significant b/l Pleural Effusions. She had a 
right sided thoracentesis with significant improvement in her 
respiratory status. Fluid was transudative, most likely from 
___ exacerbation in a COPD patient, likely causing perfusion to 
poorly ventilated zones. She was further diuresed and prior to 
floor transfer she was on 3L NC with SaO2 93-95% and 
comfortable. 

POST FICU:  Ms. ___ transferred to the general surgical 
floor on POD8 where she remained without incident until 
discharge on POD10.  An ultrasound was obtained to rule out 
right upper extremity thrombosis (given some increased right arm 
edema), antibiotics were discontinued and her foley removed.  
The remainder of the hospital course was relatively 
unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable condition, 
eating well, ambulating independently, voiding without 
difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On exam, 
incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of 
hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given explicit 
instructions to follow-up in clinic in approximately four weeks 
time for ___ evaluation with Dr. ___ 
back to her PCP for routine ___ evaluation and set-up 
with pulmonary for ongoing work-up of her CPOD and requirement 
of supplemental oxygen. She was discharged home with visiting 
nurse services, home oxygen services and home physical therapy.

STUDIES: 
TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the 
basal to mid inferior and inferolateral segments. Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image 
quality. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
.
IMPRESSION: No endocarditis or abscess seen (trans-thoracic echo 
cannot exclude). Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent 
with CAD (inferior ischemia/infarction). Mild aortic 
regurgitation.
.
CXR:  No previous images. Low lung volumes may account for the 
prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. No evidence 
of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute pneumonia. 
.
CT abd/pelvis ___:
1. Marked splenomegaly, measuring 17.5 cm, with a large 
wedge-shaped 
geographic hypodense lesion at the lower pole, most likely acute 
or subacute infarct. Alternatively, this could represent 
abscess, although does not demonstrate rim enhancement. 
.  
2. Atherosclerotic disease with calcification of the splenic 
artery, with possible arterial filling defect. However, no other 
end organ infarct is evident in the torso. 
.  
3. Focal wall thickening and edema of the rectum, without 
abscess. This could reflect proctitis. 
.  
4. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with compressive 
atelectasis. 
Prominent degree of atelectasis at the right lung base, and 
superimposed infectious consolidation is possible. 
.  
5. Post-surgical changes in the right mid abdomen after right 
colectomy, with stranding, but no focal collection to indicate 
abscess. 
.  
6. Moderate ascites tracking through the abdomen and pelvis. No 
focal 
collection. 
.  
7. Possible non-occlusive thrombus in the right internal jugular 
vein, although not completely imaged. This could be artifactual. 
This can be further assessed via ultrasound. 
.  
8. Right adrenal nodule measuring 18 x 15 mm, incompletely 
assessed on single-phase contrast study. 
.
ABD U/S:Dedicated examination of all four quadrants demonstrates 
less than 1 cm pocket of fluid in the right lower quadrant. No 
other ascitic fluid collection is noted within the peritoneal 
cavity. Due to the insufficient quantity of ascites, no 
paracentesis was attempted. 
.
EKG:  ___.
Sinus rhythm at 70, e/o inferior MI.   
.  
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST ___: Prelim
1. Multiple areas of increased FLAIR signal in the bilateral
parietal and occipital lobes, gyriform and amorphous in
appearance with associated enhancement; no decreased diffusion 
or
negative susceptibility. DDx includes areas related to subacute
nfarcts/ischemic changes, cerebritis/septic emboli with
superimposed subacute hemorrhage. (given the h/o recent
coelctomy, postop MI and bleeding diathesis). Correlate with 
labs
and consider follow up with non-contrast CT Head after 12 hours
to assess the dense appearance on CT noted earlier.   
2. Associated FLAIR hyperintense signal in the adjacent sulci 
and
diffusely in the dura and subtle increased signal of the CSF in
the basal cisterns also raise the possibility of superimposed
meningeal invovlement. Given the presence of bilateral subdural
fluid collections, intracranial hypotension in appropriate
circumstances is also in the Ddx and LP needs to be considered
with caution. Correlate with history if LP was performed 
earlier.
.
3. Internal carotid artery flow voids are not clearly
identifiable on the axial T2W images and MRA Head can be
considered for better assessment of arteries and to exclude
arterial cause of the findings, although the above mentioned
parenchymal changes, if related to ischemia/infarction can be
more likely to be venous/hypoxic etiology as well given the
history and distribution.   
4. Patent superior sagittal sinus and right transverse sinus;
left not well seen- ? hypoplastic   
D/w ___ by ___ on ___ at 5pm.   
5. Fluid in the mastoid air cells and maxillary sinuses on both
sides. 
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___:
1. Bihemispheric parieto-occipital cortical gyriform
hyperdensity, unchanged over the 16 hour interval. Given the
corresponding enhancement in these sites on the MR study, this
may represent early mineralization of cortical laminar necrosis,
related to subacute infarction. 
2. No evidence of interval hemorrhage or territorial infarction. 

3. Bilateral subdural fluid collections, overall unchanged in
size and configuration, with further resorption of blood 
products
on the right. 
4. Mastoid and paranasal sinus inflammatory disease, perhaps 
with
both chronic and acute components, though some of the layering
fluid, including in the nasopharynx and posterior nasal cavity
likely relates to intubation and supine positioning. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an ___ year old male with a history of alcoholic 
cirrhosis c/b varrices, HTN, HL who initally presented to 
___ on ___ with complaints of chest/abdominal 
pain, and found the have an obstruction of the colon at the 
hepatic flexure.  He underwent right hemicolectomy with 
end-to-end anastamosis on ___.  His post-operative course 
was complicated by post-operative fevers to 104, and was on and 
off of multiple
antibiotics including unasyn, vancomycin, cefepime,
moxiflocacin, metronidazole and imipenem. He had a PEA arrest on 
___ in the setting of an anterolateral MI complicated by 
cardiogenic shock (EF to 30%) requiring dobutamine for pressor 
support.  Additionally, the patients platlets weere orginally 
200,000 and are currently 11,000.  He has had 2 HIT antibodies 
that were negative at ___.  He required multple plt 
and PRBC transfusions.  The patients hospital course was 
additionally complicated by a reported an acute change in mental 
status. Head CT was concerning for b/l high parietal 
intraparenchymal hemorrhages without mass effect. He was 
transferred to ___ for further care.
.
Patient has been on the SICU service since transfer on ___.  
He has been followed by the ___, neurology, and hematology 
service in evaluation of multiple medical problems.  An MRI/CT 
were obtained, showing ribboning of pareito-cccipital cortex 
suggestive of laminar necrosis, no subarachnoid blood, bilateral 
subdural hydromas with layering suggestive of repeated bleeds at 
diff time-points, and increased T2 signal in pachymeninges 
suggestive of irritation due to subdurals or possibly 
intracranial hypotension. Distribution of abrnomal cortical 
signal and characteristics suggestive of vacular event in 
watershed distribution. It was felt that the cause could be 
multifactorial contributing factors could include MI, 
hypovolemia and anemia needing repeated trransfusions by report, 
coagulopathy due to
liver disease, cerebrovascular disease. However, the findings
were not felt to account for mental status, with encephalopathy 
due to more potential to metabolic-toxic causes.  ___ felt that 
no surgical indications were present, and quickly signed off.  
He has shown no meaningful neurologic improvement over the 
course of his hospitalization.  Exam has consitently showed in 
tact brainstem function. EEG obtaid was consistent with severe 
encephalopaty: toxic metabolic vs. anoxic brain injury.  
.
With continued ventilator dependence, the patient underwent 
traceostomy placement percutanesusly on ___.  The SICU team has 
been unable to maintain patient on PS, w/ reported tachypnea.  
CT of the chest on ___ showed moderate bilateral pleural 
effusions with compressive atelectasis, a prominent degree of 
atelectasis at the right lung base, and superimposed infectious 
consolidation is possible. A mini and normal BAL were performed, 
with cultures growing klebsiella pneumonia.  The patinet has had 
persistnet fevers throughout the hospitalization.  He was 
initially started on vancomycin on ___, which was discontinued 
on ___.  He was also started on zosyn on ___, and fluconazole 
for yeast in his urine on ___.  He was continued on meropenem, 
vancomycin and micafungin.   
.
The patinet has continued to have persistent pancytopenia.  His 
thrombocytopenia has been refractory to transfusions.  
Hematology was consulted and initially felt that the etiology of 
both impaired bone marrow function related to sepsis and acute 
illness, as well as increased consumption of platelets from 
recent hemorrhage (GI and cerebral) and possible hypersplenism 
related to liver disease.  However, bone marrow biopsy on ___ 
showed AML.  Given patients poor prognosis and functional status 
he was not a cnadidate for treatment.

A family meeting was help on ___ regarding goals of care.  
Given his hypotension that was pressor dependent, persistant 
fevers, poor mental status, and new diagnosis of AML the family 
agreed to no escalation of care.  The patient passed away at 
10:45pm on ___ with the family at the bedside.

choleycystitis complicated by bile leak in ___ who presented 
with abdominal pain since the night prior to presentation and 
acute pancreatitis.  He reports over the past week prior to 
presenting to the ED he had occasional ""shocks"" and feeling of 
discomfort running down his abdomen that he describes as ""like 
an ice cream headache.""  The night before presentation around 
midnight he developed acute abdominal pain that was diffuse and 
felt like extreme distension.  He also felt very chilled and 
cold, took BP at home and was 80/53.  Presented to OSH where he 
did have non-bloody vomiting though he denies significant 
nausea.   At OSH received ampicillin-sublactam and NS.  Labs 
notable for lipase and amylase >1000.  Had a RUQ U/S that showed 
dilated CBD to 13 mm w/o clear stone and a CT that showed air in 
biliary tree.  Pain was initially ___ out of 10 and improved 
with hydromorphone to manageable level.  He was transferred here 
for further management.  Reports normal bowel movements through 
the morning prior when had a nonbloody BM.   No fevers at home.  
Reports anorexia since onset of pain.  No recent weight loss or 
gain.  Not passing gas but burping.  Reports some anxiety 
(reports wife's nephew recently died of pancreatitis). 

In the ED all vital signs were stable after hydration at OSH.  
Pt was not acutely nauseous.  He was seen by biliary surgery who 
felt no acute surgical management as his CBD dilation was stable 
and he overall appeared well.   Pain at ___ at time of transfer

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o. man with history of DMII, HTN, and cholelithiasis and 
choleycystitis s/p choleycystectomy early this year presenting 
with acute abdominal pain and pancreatitis. 

1) Acute pancreatitis: The patient presented with acute 
abdominal pain, nausea, and anorexia with lipase >1000 very 
suggestive of acute pancreatitis.  Imaging also showed 
pancreatic edema.  Given dilated bile ducts, history of 
cholelithiasis, and previous manipulation of the bile ducts 
initially major concern was for an obstructing stone.  Multiple 
imaging studies (including OSH CT, OSH U/S, and MRCP at ___ 
all showed no obstructing stone of flow void.  Therefore, GI and 
surgery both felt that dilation was chronic after surgery and 
pancreatitis was unrelated.   Therefore, patient was managed 
conservatively with fluids, analgesia, and NPO status.  On 
hospital day three he began to notice significant improvement in 
is pain and was transitioned to an oral diet and oral analgesia. 
 He handled advancement of his diet well.  Regarding etiology of 
pancreatitis this remains unknown.  Given no stone and patient 
emphatically denied heavy alcohol use presumably due to 
medication or idiopathic.  Highest probability med among those 
he takes is simvastatin so this was held and will continue to be 
held at discharge (though still considered unlikely culprit as 
he had been on it for some time).  He should discuss with his 
PCP attempting another statin as this continues to be a quite 
unlikely cause.  Metformin was also held in the hospital and on 
discharge as the starting and stopping of this med prior to 
presentation makes it the only major change in his meds.  It is 
not a typical culprit medication for pancreatitis but as he also 
had GI symptoms he found extremely unpleasant with it he had it 
held and will discuss alternative agents of glycemic control 
with his PCP.   

2) Hyperbilirubinemia- The patient presented with a normal 
bilirubin but then this increased to a peak of 2.8.  This was 
primarily an indirect hyperbilirubinemia and etiology was 
unclear.  There were no other signs or symptoms to suggest 
hemolysis and after a brief increase this sharply improved so it 
was 2.0 on day of discharge.  Pt will follow up with his PCP for 
___ recheck.  

3) Hypotension: Pt had transient hypotension prior to 
hospitalization at home. Unclear etiology.  He was initially 
treated with ampicillin-sublactam for presumed cholangitis but 
given not a great story for obstruction and no right upper 
quadrant pain this was stopped on hospital day 2.  He was never 
hypotensive again and cultures remained negative.  Suspicion 
this was perhaps due to a vagal episode in context of new pain, 
chills, and nausea.  During hospitalization the patient had one 
low grade fever to 100.7 but given negative infectious work up 
this was thought due to pancreatitis.  At time of discharge he 
had been off antibiotics for >48 hours with steady improvement 
in his clinical picture.

4) Acute on chronic diastolic CHF/mild hypoxia- Mr ___ had 
signs of diastolic dysfunction on echo during his last 
hospitalization and during this hospitalization in the context 
of getting large volumes of fluid and having not a great deal of 
outs he had hypoxia to high ___ on room air and crackles on lung 
exam (was never really dypsneic).  Imaging consistent with 
volume overload.  As he was still NPO and was making good urine 
he was allowed to autodiurese.  At time of discharge, pt was 
sating 96% on RA and maintained sats >90% during ambulation. Pt 
should follow up in the outpatient setting can can consider PFTs 
and pulmonology consult. Pt likely has an element of COPD due to 
long smoking history. However, he did not display signs of flare 
during admission.

5) Pneumobilia: Pt had pneumobilia on initial imaging that was 
discussed with surgery who felt it was post procedural air and 
did not suggest abdominal catastrophe (exam was consistent with 
this as well) and further imaging revealed no evolution or 
change.  

6) Anxiety: he was continued on his home alprazolam PRN

7) Diabetes Mellitus type 2, uncontrolled, without complication: 
He was transitioned to insulin sliding scale on presentation and 
will be transitioned back to PO anti-hypoglycemics at discharge. 
 Metformin held (""see discussion under Acute Pancreatitis"")

8) Hypertension: His ACEi was initially held due to reported 
hypotension at home.  His renal function remained stable and he 
had no further hypotension so this was restarted.
.
Transitional Issues:
-He will follow up with his PCP to monitor bilirubin and to make 
sure this resolved to the normal range
-He will follow up with his PCP to discuss restarting another 
statin given unclear simvastatin was cause of pancreatitis
-He will follow up with his PCP to discuss diabetes management 
as Mr ___ reports a pretty classical pattern of GI 
disturbance due to metformin and is quite reluctant to take this 
going forward, this will be held on discharge and he will follow 
up with PCP to discuss this an with a record of blood glucoses 
off the medication
 
Medications on Admission:
lisinopril 10 mg PO DAILY 
alprazolam 0.25 mg PO TID as needed for anxiety.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with inflammation of your pancreas that is 
called pancreatitis.  You were given IV fluids, bowel rest, and 
medication for pain and nausea. Your imaging studies did not 
find a cause to your pancreatitis. The exact cause is unclear, 
it is possible that your pancreatitis was related to one of your 
medications. It is important that you follow a low fat diet as 
well as avoid alcohol as this could precipitate further 
episodes.

Your medications have been changed.  Your simvastatin was held 
as it can cause pancreatitis and your metformin was held as it 
was making you feel ill.  You can discuss alternatives to these 
medications with your PCP.  Otherwise please continue to take 
your medications as previously prescribed.  

Since your metformin was stopped you may have higher blood 
glucose values.  It is important you check your sugars twice a 
day (once in the morning and once after a meal) and have these 
to discuss with Dr. ___ you follow with him.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
================
___ RUQ US
1. Mildly distended and thickened gallbladder wall with luminal 
sludge.  
Intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.  Findings 
___ reflect cholangitis secondary to a passing stone.  Consider 
MRCP to better assess. 
2. Right suprarenal echogenic mass better assessed on prior CT 
and is most 
suggestive of adrenal myelolipoma. 
3. Splenomegaly measuring 15.5 cm. 

___ TTE
The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right 
atrium is markedly enlarged. There is no
evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity 
size. There is normal regional and global left ventricular 
systolic function. Quantitative biplane left ventricular 
ejection fraction is 68 %. Left ventricular cardiac index is 
normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular 
outflow tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size 
with normal free wall motion. Intrinsic right ventricular 
systolic function is likely lower due to the severity of 
tricuspid regurgitation. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for 
gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal. There is 
no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened with no mitral 
valve prolapse. There is moderate mitral annular calcification. 
There is trivial mitral regurgitation. Due to acoustic 
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation could be 
UNDERestimated. The pulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial 
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated atria. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global biventricular systolic function. 
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation and
pulmonary hypertension.

___ TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with with focal 
akinesis fo the basal to mid inferior and hypokinesis of the 
basal to mid inferoseptal walls. . Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The 
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal 
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild 
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet 
is eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral 
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild, eccentric aortic 
regurgitation. Thoracic aortic dilatation.
No convincing pneumonic infiltrate..  No frank consolidation or 
gross 
effusion. Minimal left costophrenic angle blunting is probably 
unchanged. 
Minimally displaced fractures of the right seventh and eighth 
posterolateral ribs.  The eighth rib fracture is probably not

presented to ___ on ___ after being found down and 
confused.  Found to have ___, and elevated trops, now resolved. 

#  Acute on Chronic encephalopathy
The patient presented with worsening confusion in the setting of 
acute renal failure and abnormal cardiac enzymes. Mental status 
improved with IVF's and supportive care.

# Type 2 NSTEMI
The patient was noted to have significantly elevated pro-BNP and 
troponin on admission. He was asymptotic and had no signs of 
volume overload. He underwent ECHO which showed slightly reduced 
EF and likely WMA. He was seen by cardiology who recommended 
starting a statin and a stress test. Ultimately patient decided 
he would not want intervention should stress test be positive 
therefore test canceled. He was continued on aspirin and Plavix.

#  Acute renal failure on CKD stage II - Cr 1.6, BUN 44 with 
baseline Cr 1.1-1.2. Likely prerenal ___ d/t poor PO intake as 
it resolved with IVF's.

#  Distal LLE DVT  
Patient with DVT in left posterior tibial vein seen on 
ultrasound on ___ which was not treated in setting of multiple 
falls. Pt has not had significant HD instability, CP, SOB, or 
hypoxia to suggest PE.  Repeat ___ did not show DVT so he was 
not further anti-coagulated.

# BLE Cellulitis 
R>L with +bullae formation mild warmth, likely more venous 
stasis changes. He was treated briefly with antibiotics but 
these were discontinued as he was felt not to be infected.

# L eye conjunctivitis
+conjunctivitis with thick discharge and crusting in L>R eye.  
Treated with erythromycin ointment with improvement. 
 
#  Recurrent Fall
#  Right rib fractures 
___ evaluated patient and recommended SNF however patient was 
adamantly refusing at first - desired to go home however has 
known history of self-neglect and refusing home health agencies 
at home and stated he did not wish to have someone in his home 
at all times. Palliative and hospice was discussed with patient 
and he was initially interested however then decided against 
this after speaking to a hospice representative. He ultimately 
agreed to SNF placement after extensive discussion explaining 
why patient was not safe to go home unless he had 24 hour care. 

#  Recurrent Cdiff x2
Pt with multiple episodes of c.diff prior to admission, s/p 
vancomycin courses, all due to abx use for UTIs.  He was given 
prophylactic vancomycin while on abx for cellulitis, this was 
discontinued when antibiotics were stopped.

# H/o arrhythmia 
h/o recent admission for ? aflutter. Decision not to 
anticoagulate and left on Toprol XL. 

#Sacral ulcer
Debrided at bedside by general surgery, seen by wound nurse for 
dressing recs.  Will see Surgery in f/u as OP.

Greater than 30 minutes spent on discharge counseling and 
coordination of care.

ACUTE ISSUES:
==============
# Acute Mixed Hypoxemic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
# Probable mild smoke inhalation injury 
Patient was pulled unconscious from a fire in his home. He was 
initially requiring nonrebreather, wheezing, on ___ NC in the 
ED and initial blood gases were concerning for both hypoxemic 
and hypercarbic respiratory failure. His prior blood gasses 
suggested against chronic hypercarbia. Initially, was planned 
for ICU admission. In ED, after he received IV steroids and 
nebulizer x1, improved both in terms of his acid/base status and 
his encephalopathy. Therefore, admitted to the general medicine 
floor, and was breathing comfortably on RA. ED had lower concern 
for smoke inhalation injury. Attempted to institute nebulizer 
treatments during admission, but patient declined.

# Encephalopathy 
Initially confused and altered in ED, then returned back to 
baseline but remained tangential in his speech and somewhat 
inattentive. Suspect related to inhalation rather than hepatic 
encephalopathy, though he is on chronic opioids and unclear if 
he may have overdosed. Did not require narcan in ED. Tox screen 
negative for all except opiates and methadone. He had no 
asterixis to suggestive hepatic encephalopathy.

# Abdominal Pain and Distension
# Ascites 
# Secondary bacterial peritonitis
Reported abdominal pain and distension, initially suspected from 
ascites as he seemed overall fluid overloaded despite reporting 
compliance with diuretics (had lower extremity edema to the 
buttocks as well). Has a history of chronic PVT and SVT. Does 
not follow low salt diet or fluid restriction at home. RUQUS 
showed large volume ascites. Paracentesis was done in ED, 
initially negative, but subsequent paracentesis with culture 
growing E. coli and strep salivarius (likely contaminant), 
thought to be potentially secondary bacterial peritonitis from 
bowel microperforation. He clinically appeared well. He 
completed Zosyn for a ___nd was switched to 
cefpodoxime for phrophylaxis at 200mg daily. Diuretics were held 
in the setting of ___, discussed below, and restarted at lower 
dose prior to discharge, as discussed below. Nutrition was 
consulted to emphasize adherence to 2g sodium diet and 2L fluid 
restriction. 

# ___ 
Cr peaked at 1.5 from baseline of 1.0. Improved with albumin 
100g ___, 60g ___. He was also given additional 25 g on ___ 
after paracentesis, and 25g on ___ for mildly low sodium. 
Spironolactone and Lasix were initially held, but restarted at 
50 and 20, respectively. He will continue this at discharge. 
Nadalol was held and should continue to be held at discharge.

# Decompensated HCV cirrhosis
# Esophageal varices s/p banding
He has cirrhosis ___ HCV (genotype 2, s/p Epclusa and ribavirin) 
c/b esophageal varices s/p ligation on Nadolol, recent banding 
___ for 2 cords of grade II varices in distal esophagus, 
portal hypertensive gastropathy, rectal varices, Hx HE on 
Lactulose, portal and splenic vein thromboses ___, chronic 
portal vein thrombosis ___, no longer on transplant list (too 
well). Concern for decompensated cirrhosis based on above 
(ascites, ___ and worsening LFTs. LFTs improved rapidly, 
suggesting that they were a change in setting of smoke 
inhalation/hypoxia. RUQUS with patent portal vessels and no 
acute cause for decompensation. Reported only taking Lactulose 
daily instead of TID as prescribed. For esophageal varices s/p 
ligation, EGD was done and revealed varices s/p banding, no 
further procedure required at this time. Nadalol was held at 
discharge given ___.

# Multiple abdominal venous thrombi
Has had thrombi in multiple areas on prior imaging as well. CT 
from ___ showing increased superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, 
and stable splenic, main portal, and right portal vein thrombi. 
Discussed with hepatology, since these are chronic, risk of
anticoagulation (especially with varcies) exceeds benefit. 
Anticoagulation was deferred.

# Thrombocytopenia, pancytopneia
Acute on chronic thrombocytopenia thought i/s/o decompensated 
cirrhosis, possible consumption from fall and guaiac + stool, 
and also could be worsened in setting of cefpodoxime 
prophylaxis. Patient 

# Coagulopathy 
# Appears Malnourished
INR 1.6 in ED, likely nutritional, improved with vitamin K 
challenge. Nutrition consulted.

# Guaiac positive stool
On rectal in ED, brown. Denies melena. Known rectal varices. 
Recent EGD with banding of esophageal varices. Not concerned for 
active GI bleed. EGD done in house revealing varices s/p 
banding. Needs a colonoscopy per hepatology notes. 

# Chronic pain on methadone and morphine
Patient methadone was stopped 3 week 
Complaining of knee pain and hip pain. Per patient, stopped 
methadone (takes this for chronic pain) three weeks prior to 
date of discharge due to the advice of Dr. ___. 
Last script filled ___. Patient was not given methadone 
during 15 day hospital stay, and tolerated this well. We will be 
discharging the patient without methadone and on morphine ___ 
15mg q6h prn (same as home dose), with plan to continue tapering 
as outpatient with PCP ___ psychiatrist Dr. ___.

# Elevated CK
Elevated CK 96 suspect related to his fall, though did not see 
any major signs of trauma. 

# Type 2 NSTEMI / Troponinemia
Mildly elevated troponin peaked at 0.04, mild initial CK-MB 
elevation but MB index normal. No ischemic changes on EKG, no 
chest pain or dyspnea, suspected ___ CK elevation

# Insomnia
Sleep has been poor due to cirrhosis for years. Sometimes takes 
alprazolam at night for this but not often. Trialed trazodone, 
held benzo and zolpidem for possible encephalopathy and these 
were stopped at discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
================
# Anxiety/MDD/PTSD 
Outpatient followup. Psychiatry: Dr. ___ - SW: ___ - 
H/O polysubstance abuse, PTSD 

# IDDM
Continued home lantus 32u, uptitrated to 37U Qbedtime, ISS. 

This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain 
medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached 
medication list for details). As part of our safe opioid 
prescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid 
risks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to 
discuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to 
determine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.

History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman 
with a history of GBS in ___, secondary syphilis s/p tx, 
cirrhosis, polysubstance abuse, pulmonary hypertension. She now 
presents with shortness of breath and abdominal pain.  
.  
She has had baseline exertional shortness of breath since ___ 
and has been on 2L home O2. She has been short of breath with 
less than 1 block walking since then. For the past week, she has 
become even more short of breath and now can not even walk 
across the room without getting short of breath. She denies any 
fevers, chills, chest pain, or cough. She has had poor PO intake 
secondary to nausea over that same interval. She denies 
orthopnea (states she has always used 3 pillows because of 
dizziness with lying but no increased shortness of breath) and 
also denies lower extremity edema.  
.  
Her abdominal pain is chronic but worsening over the past 2 
months and is described as ""knots."" It is diffuse and constant. 
She has seen Dr. ___ ___ for this in the past without 
any clear etiology identified.  
.  
In the ED, initial VS: T97.8, BP 130/62, HR 67, RR 20, O2 95% on 
2L  
There was initially concern for recurrent GBS, and neurology saw 
her. The resident was initially concerned for NIDP, but after 
CXR showed a RLL infiltrate and she spoke to her attending this 
was thought to be very unlikely. She was given Levofloxacin 750 
mg IV x 1 and Vicodin x 1 and admitted for further management.  
.  
On the floor, she feels her abdominal pain and dyspnea have not 
changed. She has not yet had a bowel movement. She is passing a 
lot of gas after the Baricat. She denies cough, fever, chest 
pain. She also denies lower extremity or other weakness or 
numbness. She further denies headache, urinary symptoms, current 
nausea.

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is 
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The 
right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global 
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position 
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

CT abdomen:
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Moderate amount of ascites in the right upper quadrant 
surrounding a 
non-distended gallbladder of uncertain etiology, question 
redistribution of 
ascites. No evidence of extravasation of oral contrast or 
extraluminal gas.  
Recommend correlation with LFTs and consider RUQ ultrasound as 
clinically 
warranted. Updated findings discussed with Dr. ___ on 
___. 
  
2. Enlarged heart, predominantly involving the right heart with 
findings of 
right heart failure. 
  
3. Interval resolution of left pleural effusion and decrease of 
right pleural 
effusion and associated bibasilar atelectasis. 
  
4. Multiple uterine fibroids. 
  
CXR:
FINDINGS: AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained. There 
is mild 
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Bilateral lower lobe 
patchy opacities 
are concerning for pneumonia. There may also be right middle 
lobe 
involvement. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could be 
due to a trace 
effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal 
silhouettes 
are stable. Mild prominence of the main pulmonary is again 
noted. The 
cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. 
  
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities, worrisome for pneumonia. 

KUB:
IMPRESSION: Air-distended loops of small bowel in the mid 
abdomen without 
evidence of bowel obstruction. No evidence of free air. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with an extensive past medical 
history presenting with shortness of breath and abdominal pain.  

.  
# Shortness of breath: She has many possible reasons to be short 
of breath. Radiology was concerned for pneumonia. She does not 
have fevers/chills/cough and CT abdomen not concerning for 
pneumonia.  Did not keep patient on antibiotics. Regarding her 
underlying disease:  
1) Moderate restrictive disease with TLC 52% was identified in 
___, and the etiology has not been identified as far as I can 
tell. Her VC with bedside spirometry was stable but low on 
admission; vital capacity 1.6 L and NIF 20 with poor effort  2) 
Severe pulmonary HTN was also diagnosed and confirmed on cath in 
___. However, this was initially thought to be secondary to 
inhaled cocaine use, which she currently denies although Utox 
positive for cocaine. Crack-induced pulmonary hypertension seems 
to be mostly related to local vasocontstrictive effects and thus 
only present in the setting of active use, but there may be some 
degree of chronic granulomatous inflammation triggered by former 
use. She could also have primary pulmonary hypertension. In any 
case, she needs further outpatient evaluation of the status of 
her pulmonary hypertension and treatment if this is indeed the 
cause of her severe shortness of breath.  
3) Other possible causes of her chronic shortness of breath 
include asthma, but no wheezing and currently moving good air. 
Patient kept on home regimen of Flovent with nebs prn wheezing.  
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating mononeuropathy (CIDM) was 
also initially on the differential although, per the ED, this 
was considered unlikely after neurology attending weighed in. 
She doesn't have enough ascites on exam to make this the likely 
cause. L-sided heart failure also on the differential but less 
likely given CXR and exam.  
.
TTE was done to evaluate for evidence of persistent pulmonary 
HTN  and showed severe pulmonary HTN.  Recommend outpatient 
PFTs/pulmonary visit. Per neurology, ordered TSH (normal). 
Neurology consult also recommended outpatient thyroid US, which 
we will defer to PCP.  Continued her home regimen of Flovent, 
nebs prn wheezing (none on discharge), and O2 as needed to

#Right heart failure: Heart size enlarged on CXR.  CTabdomen 
with evidence of RHF.  BNP elevated at 3401 (has been much 
higher in past).  Patient certainly at risk for right heart 
failure secondary to chronic pulmonary HTN. TTE showed severe 
pulmonary HTN
.  
# abdominal pain: Chronic but worsening over the past few 
months. CT abdomen without any acute process. History not 
consistent with recurrence of ulcer, and patient on both PPI and 
H2 blocker. She doesn't have tense ascites causing this. The 
pain is more diffuse than what would be expected if this were 
related to her liver disease (hepatic fibrosis, stage 2 pr 
biopsy ___ on admission, nl ALT with slightly elevated AST).  
The underlying process has not been identified despite regular 
follow up with GI in ___, but the patient has been failing to 
keep her appointments over the past 6 months. Patient has 
outpatient appointments with GI including an appointment for 
endoscopy within the next month.  Currently her pain may be 
exacerbated by constipation. Alternatively, part of the pain may 
be due to uterine fibroids (seen on CT)/other gynecological 
cause.  Patient has recently had vaginal US and appears to be 
having gyn follow-up although again she has a history of missing 
appointments.   Continued carafate, ranitidine and omeprazole 
and her outpatient pain regimen (Vicodin).  Placed her on bowel 
regimen  but she did not have a BM.  She will have outpatient 
follow-up with GI previously scheduled
.  
# HTN: normotensive.  continued Metoprolol Tartrate 37.5 mg 
PO/NG BID

she attributes to missing her dose of gabapentin.  able to move 
legs normally.  Neurology consulted and recommend workup with 
vit B12, MMA, and SPEP for neuropathy.  Patient has outpatient 
f/u with neurology already scheduled.  Will defer workup to 
outpatient physician. Continue gabapentin.  Will defere vit B12 
to PCP or outpatient neurology.

History of Present Illness:
___ with recurrent breast cancer on chemo with carboplatin, 
taxotere, Herceptin (last chemo ___, Neulasta ___ 
transferred to the FICU from the radiology suite after a 
questionable anaphylactic reaction (dyspnea, hypoxia, 
tachycardia, and flushing) to IV contrast for CTA vs worsening 
volume overload.

Briefly, she presented to the ED with fever to 104 and rigors at 
home, with no obvious source of infection except for HSV-2 
vaginal rash and chest rash. She had been seen by dermatology 
the day prior who recommended Valtrex 1g po BID x 5 days; it is 
unclear whether this had been started. She was also being 
evaluated for a rash on her chest thought to be a 
hypersensitivity rash related to chemotherapy; she was supposed 
to start a course of oral prednisone but had not yet started. Pt 
denies dyspnea, cough and chest pain (other than at the skin at 
the site of rash). Patient denied any urinary symptoms except 
some burning related to vaginal herpes rash; also complained of 
abdominal pain and loose stools over the last few days. She did 
endorse nausea at the time but denied emesis, and had not had 
nausea at home.

___ the ED, vital signs were T 100.9 HR 133 BP 89/53 RR 18 O2sat 
93% RA. Patient received 2L IVF fluid, blood/urine cultures were 
sent and she was given a dose of cefepime and vancomycin. She 
was admitted to the ___ service for further 
management. On the floor, she was given 20mg IV Lasix for 
possible fluid overload (she was recently started on a thiazide 
over the last few weeks due to some edema). She was persistently 
tachycardic to the low 100s and somewhat short of breath, so was 
sent for CTA to rule out PE.  Apparently after receiving IV 
contrast, she became dyspneic and tachycardic to the 170s. She 
was placed on a non-rebreather and a Code Blue was called for 
anaphylaxis. During the code, she got an EpiPen, hydrocortisone 
100mg IV, Benadryl 25mg IV x2, and famotidine IV, and was 
transferred to ___ for further management.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T 102.9, HR 169, 
113/75, RR 34, 92% 2L NC. ABG on arrival to the ___ (on 2L NC) 
was 7.39/29/70/18, lactate 4.7 (increased from 2.4 earlier ___ 
the day). Patient appeared less tachypneic and stated that her 
dyspnea was ___ the FICU pt continued broad spectrum 
antibiotics which were narrowed to vancomycin after blood 
cultures returned back positive for MSSA. She was gently 
diuresed. She also developed a.fib adn was started on short 
acting diltiazam. She was followed by both dermatology and the 
ID service. 
On arrival to the floor pt reports that she is feeling better 
overall.Breathing has improved significantly as well as the 
rash. She has no chest pain or other pain.

Review of systems:  
(+) Per HPI, rigors, fevers, dyspnea. +weight gain.
(-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies 
headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies 
cough or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, 
palpitations. Denies constipation, dark or bloody stools.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for for fever.  You developed 
shortness of breath, low oxygen levels, and a fast heart rate.  
During a CT scan, your vital signs and symptoms worsened.  So 
you were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 
started on antibiotics for sepsis, a severe infection of the 
blood.  Blood and skin cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, a 
bacteria known to stick to different parts of the body.  An echo 
of the heart on the skin surface and one internally (TEE) were 
both negative for infections of the heart valves, but did show a 
mild dilation of the right ventricle heart chamber.  Cardiology 
was consulted and they felt that the right ventricle dilation 
was very mild and required no specific therapy.  They did 
recommend changing your blood pressure medicine to metoprolol 
and repeating an echo ___ one month.  While you were ___ the ICU, 
your heart rate became very fast and irregular (atrial 
fibrillation).  This resolved with medication.  Your breathing 
and oxygen levels improved with furosemide (Lasix), a diuretic.  
You should weigh yourself daily to ensure an even fluid balance 
and call your doctors if your ___ increases by more than 5 
lbs or if your ankles become more swollen.  You will need to 
complete a 3 week course of IV antibiotics for the sepsis.  
Although the source of the infection was likely the skin rash, 
your port was removed ___ case the bacteria seeded it and when it 
was removed, it looked like infection may have been present ___ 
the area of the port.  That is why a drain was left ___ place.  
You will need the drain managed by home nurses and the Surgery 
team as an outpatient.  You were also seen by Dermatology, who 
recommended continuing mupiricin ointment for the rash.  Prior 
to going home, you were given trastuzumab (Herceptin) 
chemotherapy for breast cancer.
.
WEIGH YOURSELF DAILY AND CALL A PHYSICIAN FOR WEIGHT GAIN >5 
LBS.
.
YOUR DOCTORS NEED TO ARRANGE A REPEAT ECHO ___ ONE MONTH.  PLEASE 
ENSURE YOU HAVE THIS DONE.

Discharge Instructions:
PAIN CONTROL:

- You may or may not have had a nerve block depending on the 
type of surgery. This will likely wear off later in the evening 
and it is normal to have increased pain when the nerve block 
wears off. Please take your prescribed pain medications as 
directed with food prior to the nerve block wearing off. 
 - Stay ahead of the pain!
 - Narcotic pain medications can cause constipation. Please take 
a stool softener while taking these and drink plenty of water.
 - Please plan ahead! If you are running out of your medication 
prior to your follow-up appointment please call during business 
hours with a ___ day notice. Prescription refills or changes 
cannot be addressed after normal business hours or on weekends.

NON-NARCOTIC PAIN CONTROL

- Multi-modal pain control is critical. If you are able to take 
Tylenol (acetaminophen) I would strongly encourage you to do so 
according to the instructions on the bottle. Do not take more 
than 4,000 mg of Tylenol in 24 hours.
 - NSAIDs (Advil, Motrin, Aleve, etc) are also excellent for 
pain control post-operatively. Do not take if you have had a 
bone fusion surgery, but for soft tissue procedures or most 
fracture surgeries these medications are acceptable unless you 
are unable to take for other medical reasons or unless we have 
specifically instructed you against it.
 - Elevation with the operative site above the level of the 
heart will decrease swelling and improve pain control
 - Ice or cold therapy may also be helpful. Do not keep ice or 
cold directly on the skin and do not use for more than ___ 
minutes to decrease risk of skin injury from the cold. Do NOT 
use ice when the block is still in effect as you will not know 
if you are injuring yourself. You may place the ice pack behind 
your knee if you have a bulky dressing on your foot. 
 - Every little bit helps. The faster you can come off the 
narcotic medication the better. Most of my patients do not need 
narcotics after the first post-operative visit!

 ACTIVITY:

- You will likely have swelling after surgery. Please keep the 
foot elevated on ___ pillows at all times possible. You can 
apply a dry, covered, ice-bag on top of your dressing or behind 
your knee for 20 minutes at a time as often as you like.
 - Unless instructed otherwise you should not put any weight 
down on your operated extremity until you come back for your 
first postoperative visit.

 CARE FOR YOUR DRESSING:

- Pls perform daily dressing changes to LLE w 
aquaphor/adaptic/xeroform (something non-stick), gauze, webril, 
lightly wrapped ACE
 - It is not unusual to have a little bloody staining through 
your dressing. However please call the office for any concerns.
 - Keep your dressing clean and dry. You will have to cover it 
when you bath or shower. If it gets wet please call the office 
immediately.

 PREVENTION OF BLOOD CLOTS:

- You have been instructed to take medication in order to help 
prevent blood clots after surgery. Please take your warfarin as 
you had been.

___ is a ___ year old female with h/o recent diagnosis 
of L lung mass of pleomorphic undifferentiated carcinoma on XRT, 
lung adenocarcinoma s/p R middle and lower lobectomy in ___ and 
___, admitted to the ICU at ___ on ___ with hypoxia 
requiring intubation. On morning of ___, she was found with 
altered mental status and hypoxic to O2 sat 60% on 3LNC. She was 
placed on 5L NC with O2 sat improving only to 73%, received 
125mg Solumedrol and Lovenox ___ SC for suspicion of PE. 
Transferred to ___ ED for hypoxia where she was 
intubated. Coffee-grounds seen in OGT and patient is stool 
guaiac positive. Underwent a thoracentesis that drained 600cc 
transudative fluid. On ___, she self-extubated and 
desaturated to the ___. She began to desaturate to the high ___, 
had increased work of breathing, and decreased left sided chest 
wall rise. She was re-intubated prior to transfer.  
 
She has a left endobronchial lesion in left bronchus. LLL 
completely obstructed. Mobile polypoid obstruction at takeoff to 
___. Open with PEEP, closes off PEEP. Ultimate goal is 
palliative care. Needs Rx of occlusive lesion, so transferred 
here for IP procedure.  
In early ___, patient had admission for hypoxemic 
respiratory failure, where she was intubated and found to have L 
hemithorax collapse, then had bronchoscopy revealing large LLL 
clot vs mass so transferred to ___ in event that she may require 
___ embolization for hemoptysis given hx of prior TEVAR. At ___ 
she had urgent bronchoscopy showing pedunculated mass of L main 
bronchus bifurcation. Small pedunculated section of mass was 
removed with subsequent re-expansion of LUL with residual LLL 
collapse, extubated on ___. Biopsy of mass showed 
pleomorphic/undifferentiated carcinoma. XRT was initiated on

was concern of aortobronchial fistula given hemoptysis but 
thought to be unlikely as her hemoptysis resolved and H/H 
stable. Aortogram not pursued because of ___. PET-CT and brain 
MRI done for staging. Brain MRI showed two punctate foci of 
enhancement within right middle frontal gyrus and right 
cerebellum that are indeterminate in nature but differential 
included subacute embolic infarct versus metastasis. PET-CT 
showed high FDG uptake associated with LUL mass, LLL mass in 
atelectatic LLL involving the left hilum, consistent with 
malignancy; mild FDG uptake associated with the anterior LUL and 
lingula groundglass opacities (inflammatory/ infectious etiology 
vs lymphangitic tumor spread). Hemoptysis resolved by discharge. 
She also had positive C. diff, on vancomycin 125mg q6H with end

MICROBIOLOGY:
====================

IMAGING:
===================
CXR ___:
FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  The tip of the 
endotracheal tube 
projects 6 cm above the carina.  Patient also has a nasogastric 
tube in correct position and a right-sided PICC line.  In 
addition, the patient has an aortic stent graft.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly.  Moderate right pleural effusion with both apical 
and a basal component.  Retrocardiac atelectasis.  Perihilar 
opacity on the left of unclear origin, that should receive 
attention on followup examinations.  No overt pulmonary edema.  
No pneumothorax. 

CXR ___:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient 
has been extubated.  The lung volumes have decreased.  The PICC 
line and the aortic stent graft are in unchanged position.  
There is increasing opacity in the right lung, in part due to 
patient rotation; however, the presence of new parenchymal 
opacity cannot be excluded.  Short-term repeat followup 
radiograph should be performed.  No pneumothorax.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly persists. 

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION:
1.    Left  upper  lobe  rounded  mass  with  lower  
paratracheal  lymphadenopathy  is likely  the  known  primary  
lung  tumor.    The  patient  has  had  right  middle  and right 
 lower  lobectomy  in  ___  and  ___.    Solid  nodule  in  
the  posterior  segment of  the  right  upper  lobe  is  also  
suspicious  for  malignancy.    The  right  upper lobe  bronchus 
 is  patent  as  is  the  left  upper  bronchus  while  the  
left  lower lobe  bronchus  is  completely  obstructed  with  
consequent  complete  collapse  of the  left  lower  lobe.    
2.    There  is  bilateral  non-hemorrhagic  pleural  effusion,  
moderate  to  the  left and  small  to  the  right.
3.    The  patient  is  also  status  post  stenting  of  the  
descending  thoracic  aorta for  type  B  aortic  aneurysm.    
4.    Area  of  ground  glass  with  peribronchovascular  and  
subpleural
consolidation,  mainly  in  the  superior  segment  of  the  
lingula  and  posteriorsegment  of  the  left  upper  lobe,  but 
 also  in  the  posterior  segment  of  the  right upper  lobe  
is  compatible  with  infection. Local  lymphangitic  spread 
cannot  be  excluded  also  in  light  of  mild  FDG  avidity  
in  previously  reported PET-CT.    
5.    Moderate  cardiomegaly  with  severe  coronary  artery  
calcification  and  small non-hemodynamically  significant  
pericardial  effusion.    
6.    Moderate  amount  of  ascites  and  mild  anasarca.    
Right  subclavian  PICC (2:24)  ends  in  upper  SVC.

BRONCHOSCOPY ___:
======================
Impression: Pt brought to OR where GETA was induced and ETT 
exchanged for rigid bronchoscope. Airways examined. Anastomotic 
sites from RLL and RML appeared intact. Endobronchial tumor was 
seen in LMSB resulting in 90% obstruction of lumen. This was 
cryodebrieded. ___
Otherwise normal to tracheobronchial tree 

Additional notes: flexible and rigid bronchoscopy with tumor 
destruction and tumor ablation electrocautery laser 
cryodebriedement  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with lung cancer with obstructive PNA and lung collapse 
due to endobronchial lesion who is transferred here for 
palliative stent placement and made CMO during course of 
hospitalization given overall general deterioriation that had 
been ongoing for months. Died on ___.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# GOC
Patient was made CMO during MICU hospitaliztion on ___ in line 
with patient's goals of care. Discussed decision with healthcare 
proxy. While patient was CMO, she was transferred to the floor 
where she was made comfortable with morphine drip, ativan, 
glycopyrolate and scopolamine patch. Pt subsequently died on 
___ at 0657PM. Family was at bedside. Declined autopsy. 
Pastoral and support care was provided to family.

# Lung Cancer: 
Pleimorphic/undifferentiated lung cancer by tissue diagnosis. 
Patient underwent staging PET scan that showed extensive 
pulmonary disease. Also with MRI brain that showed 2 punctate 
lesions that are unknown whether small hemorrhage or foci of 
metastasis. Patient and family have met with palliative care, 
however they wish to keep her full code at that time. Patient 
remaned intubated for the procedure and underwent cryo/laser 
ablation of left upper lobe pedunculated mass near carina. 
Patient tolerated procdure well and was extubated. She had 
moderate distress and was aggresively diuresed with lasix, given 
nebulizers, and placed on CPAP to maintain adequate oxygenation. 
Ultimately, given ongoing respiratory distress, along with 
decision with husband/health care proxy, the patient was made 
comfort measures only.
 
# C diff: 
Held treatment due to comfort focused care 

# Hypertension: 
Patient noted to be hypertensive to 180s/100s in ICU post 
extubation. Home blood pressure medications were restarted and

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service for 
evaluation and treatment.  On ___, the patient emergently 
was taken to the operating room and underwent endovascular 
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (reader referred to the 
Operative Note for details). The patient was then brought to the 
ICU intubated, sedated, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a 
foley catheter.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: While intubated, the patient was sedated with propofol. 
Following extubation, the patient received IV dilaudid with good 
effect and adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, 
the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. The patient 
was initially hypertensive out of the OR and required 
nitroglycerin drip. Oral agents were started POD2 in the ICU, 
including home carvedilol and oral hydralazine and amlodipine. 
The patient was given PRN doses of IV hydralazine. Following 
transfer to the vascular stepdown unit, the patient did not 
require further IV hydralazine. Lisinopril was held from 
admission given his elevated Cr level. It was restarted as Cr 
trended down on discharge. Amlodipine was discontinued prior to 
discharge when lisinopril was started. The patient will require 
close PCP followup for titration of antihypertensives. ___ will 
be arranged for blood pressure checks. While in the ICU, 
cardiology was consulted for co-management of the patient's CHF. 
There was a slight leak in troponin that was felt to be due to 
demand ischemia and no further troponins were checked after ICU 
stay. In addition, they recommended diuresis when able.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. Albuterol and ipratropium 
nebs were given as needed.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. OG tube was in place while intubated. Following 
extubation on POD#1, diet was advanced when appropriate, which 
was well tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely 
monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  
Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when 
necessary. Creatinine was elevated at admission from baseline 
levels. It was trended postoperatively. The patient was volume 
overloaded postoperatively. IV lasix was administered POD#1 with 
resulting diuresis. However, Cr continued to rise so no further 
lasix was administered. Foley catheter was removed POD#3 and the 
patient subsequently voided without issue. 

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. Perioperative 
antibiotics were administered.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. He was 
restarted on oral glycemic agents on discharge.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Patient will be seen in followup in 4 weeks time with Dr 
___. At that time, a CTA will be arranged to assess the 
location and function of the stent graft. Patient will also be 
seen by PCP Dr ___ on ___ in followup and for ongoing 
hypertension management.

IMAGING:
___ ECHO
Conclusions  
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The 
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate 
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ___ with 
abnormal septal motion c/w conduction abnormalities. Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the 
apical free wall. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are 
severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric jet of 
mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic 
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricular cavity with 
moderate global hypokinesis. Mild apical right ventricular 
hypokinesis. Moderate to severe aortic stenosis with trace 
regurgitation. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta. At least mild 
mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the biventricular function now appears depressed, the degree of 
aortic stenosis is moderate, and the thoracic aorta is mildly 
dilated.  

___ ECHO
Conclusions  
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left 
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left 
atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the 
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in 
the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. There are three 
aortic valve leaflets that are moderately thickened. There are 
filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with 
Lambl's excresences (normal variant). Significant aortic 
stenosis is present (not quantified though moderate to severe by 
visual estimate). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen.

IMPRESSION: Mild left atrial spontaneous echo contrast. No 
intracardiac thrombus. Significant aortic stenosis. Complex 
atheroma in aortic arch and descending aorta. Mild mitral 
regurgitation.

___ CXR
COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph. 
  
FINDINGS:  Interval increase in heart size with 
moderate-to-marked 
cardiomegaly.  Widening of right mediastinal contour could be 
due to vascular 
distention given findings of pulmonary vascular congestion and 
moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema, but underlying 
lymphadenopathy or mass is difficult to exclude without more 
recent radiographs for comparison.  
Partially loculated right pleural effusion is present, overall 
moderate in 
size with an intrafissural component.  There is also either 
loculated fluid or pleural thickening present in both apices 
laterally. 
  
Short-term followup radiographs after diuresis would be helpful 
to confirm 
resolution and to more fully evaluate the mediastinal and 
pleural findings 
described above.  If persistent despite improvement in pulmonary 
edema, CT 
would be suggested. 
  
___/ CXR
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___: 
  
Interval improvement since ___ is due to of a component 
of acute 
pulmonary edema.  What extent interstitial abnormality is due to 
chronic lung disease that developed between ___ and ___ 
is indeterminate because of the long imaging interval.  
Currently, the heart is moderately enlarged and mediastinal 
veins are dilated.  Pleural effusions are small, and there is no 
pneumothorax.  ET tube, upper enteric drainage tube, and right 
transjugular ___ catheter are in standard placements.  No 
pneumothorax.

___ RUQ US: Coarsened echogenicity and nodular contour of the 
liver in keeping with known history of cirrhosis.  Limited views 
of the liver do not demonstrate any focal hepatic lesions. 
Unchanged splenomegaly.

___ CXR 
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is 
currently no 
evidence of an aspirated tooth on the image.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly with signs of mild fluid overload persists.  The 
presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  
The nasogastric tube and the left PICC line are in unchanged 
position. 

___ CXR
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no 
relevant 
change.  Low lung volumes with crowding of vascular structures 
and unchanged mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Unchanged 
bilateral basal atelectasis at the lung bases, left more than 
right.  No new parenchymal opacity.  No larger pleural 
effusions.  Unchanged appearance of the left PICC line.

___ CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line is 
unchanged. The tip projects over the upper-to-mid SVC.  
Unchanged appearance of the lung parenchyma and of the cardiac 
silhouette.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ PMH of AS with ___ of 0.9 cm2, CHF and ILD, who is 
transferred from ___, in the setting of CHF exacerbation.

ACTIVE ISSUES

# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: He continued to decompensate 
after transfer, requiring intubation ___. His respiratory 
failure was felt to be caused largely by pulmonary edema, with 
smaller contributions from his ILD and possible HCAP. He 
improved with cardioversion of atrial flutter, diuresis of ~6L, 
and HCAP treatment. He was extubated ___ and by ___ was 
satting in the mid-90s on ___ nasal cannula, consistent with 
his baseline O2 requirement. He continued to sat well on 
low-volume nasal cannula. FYI: Be cautious with supplemental O2. 
Tirate to 92-94%. Patient will become confused if satting too 
much above this level or if he is receiving too much oxygen.

# GI Bleeding: On ___, Pt was noted to have melanotic stools. 
Heparin gtt that had been started for post-cardioversion 
prophylaxis was stopped, and octreotide and pantoprazole drips 
were started. The patient's Hct remained stable. Hepatology was 
consulted and it was felt that the bleeding was likely to to 
known portal gastropathy rather than esophageal varices. On 
___, he had BRBPR and a Hct drop from 27 to 22. He was 
transfused 2U pRBCs and emergent EGD was performed. It showed a 
bleeding ___ tear at GE junction/lesser curvature, 
which was injected w/ 4 cc epinephrine. An adherent clot in 
fundus could not be dislodged. No esophageal varices. He was 
treated with a 7-day course of ceftriaxone as prophylaxis for 
SBP. Repeat EGD was not pursued. His PPI drip was transitioned 
to BID dosing on ___. His Hct remained stable after bleed 
and was stable on discharge.
 
# SHOCK: Multifactorial. Felt mainly due to cardiogenic cause, 
given known AS, EF 30%, pulmonary and lower extremity edema. 
Hypovolemia likely playing a role as well from GI blood loss and 
diuresis. BP in the ___ for most of admission. After GI bleed 
with BRBPR, pt was hypotensive to ___ on norepinephrine. His 
norepinephrine was not able to be weaned even after 
resuscitation w/ 3U pRBCs and ~4L fluids.  Stress-dose steroids 
(50mg solumedrol q6) were empirically started ___ for possible 
adrenal insufficiency, although he was only on 5mg prednisone 
daily prior to admission. His norepinephrine was weaned on ___. 
His stress-dose steroids were tapered and taper should be 
continued post-discharge.

# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Noted to be in atrial flutter 
with 2:1 block on admission. It was thought that this arrhythmia 
could have been a major cause of his CHF exacerbation. TEE was 
performed, which showed no clot, so he was cardioverted. 50 J 
initially, went into Afib, then 200 J, went into sinus with 
frequent PACs.
He was started on amiodarone short-term because atrial kick 
critical while in decompensated heart failure. He had one other 
episode of Afib on ___ in the setting of his GI bleed. He was 
initially anticoagulated with heparin gtt after the 
cardioversion, but this was discontinued once melanotic stools 
were noted. His long term plan is for anticoagulation with 
aspirin only.

# ACUTE TOXIC METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: After intubation, the 
patient was altered for several days, withdrawing to painful 
stimuli but not following commands. Several etiologies were 
considered including slow clearance (due to liver and kidney 
disease) of the sedation given while on the vent, possible 
hepatic encephalopathy, and ICU delirium. He was initially 
treated with lactulose and then rifaximin for hepatic 
encephalopathy. His mental status slowly improved. He continues 
to have issues with confusion on waking and with too high a 
level of supplemental oxygen as above but he typically clears 
quickly.

___ DUE TO ATN: From a baseline Cr 1.0, his Cr peaked at 7.2. 
Renal was consulted and diagnosed ATN from hypotension/poor 
perfusion. His medications were renally-dosed. By discharge his 
Cr improved to 4.6 and was steadily down-trending.

# HCAP:  Resolved. Cultures from BAL with Moraxella, S. pneumo, 
and MSSA. Initially on vancomycin and cefepime (Day ___ = ___, 
switched to levofloquin and nafcillin after speciation. 
Completed 14 day course on ___.

# Steroid-induced hyperglycemia: Carries no diagnosis of 
diabetes. Hgb A1c 8.2% on admission in the setting of chronic 
steroid use. The patient's glycemic control strategy fluctuated 
with nutritional status during this admission. He was given 12U 
glargine plus sliding scale insulin coverage. He will be 
discharged on this regimen given he is continuing on steroid 
taper.

# GOALS OF CARE: Discussed extensively with patient and family 
while in hospital. After intubation he decided he would like to 
be DNR/DNI going forward. Palliative Care was consulted for 
coping and will follow as outpatient.

CHRONIC ISSUES

# AORTIC STENOSIS: Severe, ___ of 0.86 cm2 by cath. CT surgery 
evaluated him as not a surgical candidate. He is not a candidate 
for TAVR.

# Alcoholic cirrhosis: Followed by Dr. ___. EGD this admission 
shows no esophageal varices. His home spironolactone 50 bid and 
nadolol 20 qd were held this admission given hypotension. They 
were restarted on discharge.  

# Thrombocytopenia: Known to be chronically thrombocytopenic. 
Worked up by Hematology during ___ admission and felt to be due 
to underlying liver disease. Platelets fluctuated between 50-200 
during this admission.

TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta 
is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic 
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is 
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due 
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may 
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Critical aortic stenosis with trace aortic 
regurgitation. Biatrial enlargment. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and preserved 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mildly 
dilated right ventricle. Mildly dilated ascending aorta and 
aortic arch. At least mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  

Renal U/S: 
FINDINGS:  There is no hydronephrosis seen in either kidney.  
The right kidney measures 12.4 cm, and the left kidney is noted 
to be smaller measuring only 9.4 cm.  A small simple cyst is 
seen in the lateral margin of the right kidney measuring 1.2 x 
1.4 x 1.2 cm.  A small simple cyst is also seen in the 
interpolar region of the left kidney measuring 1.1 x 0.9 cm.  
There is no stone or suspicious solid mass seen in either 
kidney. No perinephric fluid collection is identified.  The 
bladder is moderately distended and is unremarkable in 
appearance. 
  
DOPPLER EXAMINATION:  Color Doppler and spectral waveform 
analysis was 
performed.  Arterial waveforms with normal sharp upstrokes are 
seen in the main renal artery of the right kidney.  Appropriate 
venous flow is seen in the main right renal vein.  Resistive 
indices of the intraparenchymal arteries in the right kidney are 
elevated measuring 0.82-0.89. 
Arterial and venous flow is identified within the left kidney, 
however 
arterial waveforms do not demonstrate any reliable diastolic 
flow. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No hydronephrosis.  There are bilateral simple renal cysts 
and the left kidney is noted to be significantly smaller than 
the right kidney. 
2.  No sonographic evidence of renal artery stenosis in the 
right kidney.  The right renal artery stent cannot be visualized 
with ultrasound.  Elevated resistive indices in the right 
kidney, consistent with chronic parenchymal disease.  Arterial 
and venous flow identified in the smaller left kidney; however, 
the arterial waveforms do not demonstrate any diastolic flow. 
Perhaps this is consistent with the reported history that the 
patient's left kidney is not functioning.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms. ___ is a ___ with history of aortic 
stenosis s/p ___ ___ complicated by pericardial tamponade 
requiring pericardiocentesis, nonobstructive CAD (cath ___ 
with 30% eccentric stenosis just after the origin of D1), renal 
artery stenosis s/p R renal stent, atrial fibrillation on 
warfarin, recurrent pleural effusion s/p left VATS pleurodesis, 
who initially presented to ___ on ___ with chest pain and 
dyspenea, found to have acute on chronic CHF with worsening 
aoritic stenosis, now transferred to ___ for corvalve 
evaluation.

# Aortic stenosis: Holding further work-up/intervention in lgiht 
of kidney function. Patient w/ severe AS with valve area by TTE 
of 0.5cm2 with peak trans AV gradient of 106mmHg. There is also 
evidence of symmetric LVH with EF of 75%. Patient had PFTs done 
Patient is not a surgical candidate. Further work-up for 
___ as an outpatient per Dr. ___ in light of kidney 
injury.

# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure exacerbation: RHC at 
___ showed at Wedge pressure of 32 mmHg with PA presure 50/2, 
mean of 31mmHg. On exam, patient's volume status is stable, as 
is her respiratory status. Patient initially received 120mg po 
lasix, but in light of rising creatinine this was held. The 
patient remained euvolemic while serum creatinine rose. 
Patient's serum creatinine fell to 2.4 on day of discharge. 
Instructed the patient to resume diuresis on ___. 

# Chronic kidney disease: Patient with chronic kidney disease; 
baseline is unknown. Her creatinine acutely rose during her 
hospitalization at ___ to 2.8. Renal was consulted. Her 
elevated serum creatinine was attributed to constrast-induced 
nephropathy superimposed on  poor forward flow secdonary to 
severe AS. Renal ultrasound at ___ showed no hydronephrosis, 
simple renal cysts and the left 
kidney, and no evidence of renal stenosis to the right kidney, 
though the arterial waveforms do not demonstrate any diastolic 
flow left kidney. Sevelamir 1800mg TID with meals was continued. 
Of note, renal ultrasound at ___ showed patent right renal 
artery stent. Of note, the patient will need a GFR of at least 
20 to participate in Corvalve trial.   
  OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Serum creatinine check ___ ___ontrast-induced nephropathy and restarting home 
diuresis ___. 

# Complicated urinary tract infection: Patient's urine anaylsis 
showed signs of UTI, and the patient complains of a pressure 
when she urinates that she has not had before. She had a Foley 
catheter in place during her hospitalization at OSH. The patient 
was started on ceftriaxone 1g every 24 hours for a pan-sensitive 
E. coli. On day of discharge, the patient was transitioned to 
amoxicillin-sulbactam (renally dosed) to take for another 12 
days in light of Foley catheter placement. 
  OUTPATIENT ISSUES: Continuation of antibiotics to complete a 
full treatment course for complicated urinary tract infection. 

# Coronary artery disease: At OSH, patient was found to have 
non-obstructive coronary artery disease during cardiac 
catheterization. She was started on simvastatin 20mg daily at 
OSH, which the the patient was instructed to continue upon 
discharge. 

# Hyponatremia: Improved this AM in light of holding diuresis. 
Partially related to patient's chronic heart failure and 
overdiuresis. TSH was within normal limits. Serum cortisol was 
slightly elevated at 20.3 (upper limit of normal 20.0).

# Atrial fibrillation: Patient arrived with heparin gtt from 
OSH. Coumadin was held in light of prcedures but restarted 
___ as no procedures would be done this hospitaliation. 
Patient's metoprolol was also conitnued at 100mg twice daily. 
Patient's primary care doctor's office was notified that the 
patient will need a coumadin check ___. 

# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin dependent as an outpatient, 
managed with NPH insulin twice daily. The patient's home regimen 
was continued through the admission with sliding scale availble 
as needed for coverage. Patient was discharged home on NPH 20 
units in the mornign and 9 units at night.   

# History of GI Bleed: In the setting of high INR found to be 
due to gastric AVMs. AVMs s/p clipping ___. Patient was 
continued on a heparin drip, and she had no episodes of GI 
bleeding during this admission. Hematocrit remained stable. 

# Pain management: Continued Vidocin PRN, Lidocaine patch, as 
well as amitriptyline.

Paracentesis ___
Transjugular liver biopsy ___

 
History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ woman with PMH of cirrhosis of 
unknown etiology c/b recurrent ascites and grade I esophageal 
varices, atrial fibrillation (on rivaroxaban), CAD, HFrEF (EF 
20% in ___, prior CVA, who presents as a transfer from OSH for 
recurrent ascites and renal failure.

The patient was recently diagnosed with cirrhosis. She is 
unclear about the full details of her diagnostic odyssey, but 
she initially presented to her PCP with abdominal distension and 
diarrhea in ___. She underwent a variety of tests and was 
referred to a surgeon at one point, before she believes she
underwent a CT scan of her abdomen and was diagnosed with 
cirrhosis at that time around ___. She has not established 
with a hepatologist for her care as of yet. In ___, the 
patient began requiring weekly paracenteses for recurrent 
ascites, getting her third paracentesis on ___ with 
removal
of 4.8L of ascites followed by 12.5gm albumin. 

Following her paracentesis, the patient was doing well 
initially, but then developed progressive generalized weakness 
which culminated in a syncopal episode while walking to her 
kitchen on ___. The patient lost consciousness for 
approximately 30 seconds, but was immediately oriented after 
regaining
consciousness. She had never had a syncopal episode in the past. 
As a result, the patient presented to ___ 
for evaluation. At presentation, she was noted to be tachycardic 
and appeared to be volume depleted. Labs were notable for WBC 
18.5, Hgb 13.6, INR 1.8, Na 131, Cl 88, BUN 29, Cr 1.7, anion 
gap 16, AST 138, ALT 53, AlkPhos 166, Tbili 2.0. UA was notable 
for 7 WBCs, 9 epis, trace bacteria. The patient was admitted and 
felt
to be likely volume depleted. As a result, she was given IVF and 
albumin with improvement in Cr to 1.0. The patient was then 
resumed on furosemide 40mg (half her home dose of 80mg) and 
spironolactone 50mg several days later. However, her renal 
function subsequently worsened. Nephrology was consulted and 
felt
that the patient may have multifactorial renal dysfunction 
secondary to cardiorenal vs hepatorenal syndrome. The patient 
previously was known to have poor cardiac function with LVEF 20% 
in ___. The patient subsequently underwent diagnostic 
paracentesis on ___ with removal of 120cc of clear yellow 
ascites
fluid with finding of albumin 1.1 (serum albumin 3.9), total 
protein 2.0, and no concern for SBP. Given the patient's 
refractory ascites and worsening renal function with diuresis, 
the decision was made to transfer the patient to ___ for 
further management.

On arrival to ___, the patient's vitals were T 98.3F, BP 
102/68, HR 84, RR 18, O2 sat 93% RA. The patient confirmed the 
above history.

2. Indeterminate 1.9 cm lesion along the inferior medial margin 
of the liver could reflect a regenerative nodule however 
attention on follow-up imaging is recommended.
3. There is no evidence of portal vein thrombosis.  Of note, the 
entire SMA
was not imaged.

ECHO ___: 
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. No 
thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium ___ 
excluded by TEE). The right atrium is moderately enlarged. There 
is no evidence for an atrial septal
defect by 2D/color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is 
normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. 
Quantitative biplane left ventricular
ejection fraction is 65 %. Left ventricular cardiac index is low 
normal (2.0-2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular 
outflow tract gradient. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity 
with normal free wall
motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with 
normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is 
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is an

mitral
regurgitation. Due to the Coanda effect, the severity of mitral 
regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild [1+] 
tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

margin of the
right lobe of the liver, which show no enhancement on the recent 
liver MR,
suggesting proteinaceous or hemorrhagic content.  Attenuation of 
the
background liver measures about 70 Hounsfield units, relatively 
high,
suggesting either iron overload or amiodarone use or toxicity in 
the
appropriate setting.
There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary 
dilatation.  The gallbladder contains dense material, likely 
small gallstones or sludge,
although tiny stones were not visualized on the MR.

1. Cirrhotic liver with ascites.
2. No evidence of acute abnormality.
 
CXR ___: 
IMPRESSION: 
 1.  Mild interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion.
2.  No focal consolidation.

PATHOLOGY 
================================================
___: Liver, transjugular biopsy:
1. Established Cirrhosis with prominent sinusoidal fibrosis ( 
confirmed by trichrome stain).
2. Hepatocytes with frequent ballooning degeneration and 
frequent intracytoplasmic hyalin. No significant steatosis.
3. Moderate septal and mild lobular mixed inflammation comprised 
of lymphocytes, neutrophils and histiocytes.
4. Focal area of bile ducts with associated neutrophils.
5. Single large vessel with myxoid changes and intimal edema.
6. Iron stain demonstrates no stainable iron.
Note: The findings are that of established cirrhosis on the 
background of toxic/metabolic injury including Amiodarone. Given 
the presence of neutrophils associated with bile ducts 
additional etiology such as biliary obstruction or sepsis should 
be ruled out. Electron microscopy will be performed and results 
will be issued as an addendum.
Electron Microscopy Addendum (C-___): Fine structural studies 
were performed on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded material, 
yielding morphology that is technically suboptimal and therefore
difficult to examine and interpret. Hepatocytes show glycogen 
granules. No evidence of phospholipidosis (""myelin figures"" or 
""zebra bodies"") is noted.

====================
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old woman with ___ recently 
diagnosed cirrhosis of unclear etiology complicated by recurrent 
ascites and grade I varices, CAD, atrial fibrillation, heart 
failure with recovered ejection fraction who presented with 
volume overload and acute kidney injury found to have amiodarone 
induced liver cirrhosis and acute tubular necrosis. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Amiodarone- Induced Liver Cirrhosis:
Patient was diagnosed with cirrhosis in ___. Cirrhosis 
is decompensated by recurrent ascites and grade I esophageal 
varices. Unclear etiology at the time of presentation. Patient 
underwent extensive work up for infectious, biochemical causes 
of cirrhosis and ultimately underwent liver biopsy. The findings 
are that of established cirrhosis on the background of 
toxic/metabolic injury including Amiodarone. Electron microscopy 
was done but was technically suboptimal and therefore difficult 
to examine and interpret. No evidence of phospholipidosis 
(""myelin figures"" or ""zebra bodies"") is noted (which is seen in 
amiodarone toxicity). Patient maintained no history of alcohol 
use. AFP within normal limits during this hospitalization. Liver 
MRI while in hospital with indeterminate 1.9 cm lesion along the 
inferior medial margin of the liver could reflect a regenerative 
nodule however attention on follow-up imaging is recommended.
- Infection: no known history of SBP, negative on multiple 
diagnostic taps while hospitalized
- Bleed: grade I esophageal varices on EGD ___, not on 
nadolol
- Encephalopathy: alert and oriented x3 throughout 
hospitalization with no known history of encephalopathy

# Recurrent ascites
Patient presented with recurrent ascites over the past several 
weeks. Diagnostic paracentesis done ___ with albumin 1.1 and 
total protein 2.0, with SAAG 2.8 consistent with transudative 
ascites. Given prior history of heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction, also considered heart failure as potential 
etiology, but found to have recovered EF as described below. 
Ultrasound and liver MRI with no portal vein thrombosis. She was 
initially maintained on oral diuretic but this was discontinued 
due to worsening ___ and concern for HRS as below.  Patient 
underwent ___ paracentesis on ___ of 1900cc fluid. She underwent 
repeat ___ paracentesis on ___ of 340cc. She was maintained on 
low salt diet. No known history of SBP and was negative on 
multiple diagnostic taps.

# ___:
Cr on presentation 1.6, from baseline of 0.9. Notably patient 
had presented to ___ with Cr elevation to 1.7. 
This had initially improved with albumin and volume 
resuscitation to baseline but subsequently worsened with 
diuretic, prompting transfer to ___.  No e/o hydronephrosis on 
renal u/s. Urine studies notable for sodium avid state. Renal 
consulted who noted that her urinary sediment did not show 
granular casts, but did show many hyaline casts indicative of 
low tubular flow, thought to be pre-renal in setting of 
diuresis. She was also noted to have monoclonal IgG lambda on 
SPEP and UPEP, however the quantity was small and unlikely to 
have caused light chain nephropathy. It could, however, have put 
her at risk for ___ with volume depletion. Patient received 
albumin challenge without initial response though notably had 
also undergone contrast study and ~2L paracentesis during this 
time period. Patient managed on escalating doses of octreotide 
and midodrine with initial improvement in blood pressure and 
creatinine to nadir 1.2.  Given low concern for HRS the 
octreotide was discontinued but she was continued on midodrine.  
Upon re-introduction of diuretic patient developed subsequent 
renal injury with creatinine rising to 1.9. She received albumin 
resuscitation. Renal re consulted and urine showed several muddy 
brown casts consistent with ATN and given adequate urine output 
they felt she was safe for discharge home with close follow up 
with PCP. If creatinine does not return to baseline then she 
should be referred to nephrology by her primary care doctor.

# Atrial fibrillation:
Patient has a history of persistent atrial fibrillation, managed 
with amiodarone, metoprolol and rivaroxaban. CHADSVASC 5 based 
on gender, CHF, prior stroke, and CAD. Given concern for 
amiodarone induced liver toxicity, amiodarone was discontinued. 
Anticoagulation initially held given liver biopsy and 
coagulopathy associated with cirrhosis. Rivaroxaban 
contraindicated in class B/C child ___ Cirrhosis. Patient 
started on apixaban but developed worsening coagulopathy with 
rising INR. Hematology consulted who felt that warfarin would 
have better safety profile in setting of severe cirrhosis, ___. 
Patient transitioned to warfarin. She was maintained on stable 
1mg daily dose of warfarin for goal INR ___.  

#Abdominal pain
#Nausea, Vomiting
Patient with intermittent ongoing nausea. Developed worsening 
abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting alongside worsening 
leukocytosis and ___ ___. Started on empiric vancomycin and 
cefepime. Cultures obtained, including peritoneal. Patient also 
underwent imaging workup out of concern for obstruction. CT with 
no intra-abdominal abnormality. Paracentesis performed with no 
evidence of SBP. Given lack of focal source and improving 
symptoms, antibiotics discontinued. 

#Hypoxia
#Productive cough 
Patient developed 2L nasal cannula oxygen requirement during 
hospitalization. CXR obtained on ___, notable for some signs of 
pulmonary edema/ cardiac dysfunction. Atelectasis also felt to 
be component. Diuresis deferred given ongoing ___ as above. 
Hypoxia resolved with incentive spirometry and more aggressive 
physical activity with physical therapy.  
 
# HF with recovered EF:
Patient has a history of heart failure, with previous LVEF 
estimated 20% per OSH records. Repeat TTE while in house notable 
for normal ejection fraction, suggestive of recovered ejection 
fraction. She was initially managed with diuretics but then 
discontinued out of concern for HRS as above. Given low blood 
pressures and ___, home lisinopril held. Patient continued on 
metoprolol while in hospital.

# UTI: 
Patient grew E coli on urine culture and was started on 
ceftriaxone 1gm Q24H on ___. She completed a three day course of 
ceftriaxone 1gm daily. 

# Syncope, resolved:
Patient presented initially to ___ after having a 
syncopal episode. Likely orthostasis in the setting of poor PO 
intake, chronic diarrhea, and vasoplegia from cirrhosis.  No 
further episodes of syncope while in the hospital.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
========================
# CAD:
- Maintained on reduced dose atorvastatin in setting of LFT 
elevation.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================================================
[] Patient will need repeat EGD in ___
[] Patient should be vaccinated against Hepatitis A and 
Hepatitis B
[] MRI with indeterminate 1.9 cm lesion along the inferior 
medial margin of the liver could reflect a regenerative nodule 
however attention on follow-up imaging is recommended.
[] Discharge creatinine 1.8 
[] Discharge weight 87.18 kg
[] Patient is diuretic refractory and has demonstrated repeated 
pre-renal injury with introduction of oral diuretic.  She should 
not be restarted on oral diuretic therapy.
[] Patient started on warfarin 1mg PO daily with goal INR ___
[] Anticoagulation will be managed by her PCPs office.
[] Amiodarone discontinued and felt to be contributor to 
cirrhosis above
[] Atorvastatin dose reduced from 80mg to 40mg in setting of 
underlying liver disease
[] Patient will benefit from home physical therapy services upon 
discharge for home safety evaluation and continued promotion of 
patient's return to their functional baseline. The patient's 
comfortable walking speed of <1.0 m/s is consistent with an 
indication for additional physical therapy to reduce the risk of 
falls.

felt that your kidney injury was from dehydration from receiving 
diuretics.
- You were treated for a urinary tract infection 
- You underwent testing for additional infection, which were 
negative

What should I do now that I am leaving the hospital?
- Continue to take your medications as prescribed.  Several of 
your blood pressure and diuretic medications were stopped while 
you were here.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is an ___ year old ___ speaking woman with 
history of CVA residual complicated by L sided deficit, CAD, 
HTN, HLD, T2DM, and cognitive decline who presented to the ED 
with 2 days of diarrhea, weakness, and fever. 
 
Per the patient's daughter as reported on the ED dashboard: Mrs. 
___ had been having large quanitities of diarrhea over 
the last 2 days. No abdominal pain. Mental status at baseline. 
Very limited history was obtained from the patient's son, who 
arrived with her on the floor. Mrs. ___ did not sleep 
last night because she had to get up so many times to use the 
restroom.  

In the ED initial vitals were: 96.9, 84, 174/69, 18, 99% on 2L. 
She was weaned to 95% on RA. Fever spiked to 101.3 while in the 
ED.
- ED labs were significant for Na 131, BUN 24, BG 256, Mg 1.5, 
Hct 32 (bilateral ___, normal lactate, and UA with few 
bacteria, neg leuk, and 5 WBCs.  
- CXR showed no pneumonia or CHF. KUB showed normal bowel gas 
pattern.  
- The patient was given 1 dose of IV ceftriaxone.  
 
On the floor, Mrs. ___ was noted to be sleepy and 
provided little history. When her son says her name, she turns 
and opens her eyes. He asks if she has any pain, she shakes her 
head. He asks how she is feeling, and she says much better.  

Per the patient's PCP documentation of physical exam in ___: 
""Elderly female, mask like face, ambulating w/ major assistance 
w/ walker, extremely slowly, unsteady gait, patient is minimally 
verbal, keeps her eyes closed most of the time but when she 
engaged in conversation still has min verbal responces- ___  
words sentences. Forgetful - poor short and longterm memory but 
she responds appropriately w/ absence of any emotions on her 
face and voice. Oriented x 1. I noted that pt became coughing 
and choking while drinking water from the bottle w/ straw.""  
The PCP notes during the ___ visit that Mrs. ___ 
has continued to decline both cognitively and from a mobility 
stand point. She expressed concern to the patient's daughter 
that her mother needs a higher level of care such as a nursing 
home or some form of 24 hour care. The daughter was documented 
to decline at that time.

REPORTS
___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
Stable appearance of the chest without convincing evidence for 
pneumonia or CHF. 

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and 
moderate 
pulmonary edema.  Moderate right and small left pleural 
effusions are also demonstrated with adjacent bibasilar 
opacities which may reflect atelectasis, aspiration, and or 
developing infectious pneumonia. 

___ Echo
Conclusions  
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be 
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion.    

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:  
  
Mild pulmonary edema which worsened on ___ has 
substantially improved. Small to moderate bilateral pleural 
effusion is smaller. Substantial bibasilar consolidation 
persists, most likely atelectasis, though not excluding 
pneumonia. The heart is partially obscured but is not severely 
dilated. Upper lungs are clear. No pneumothorax. 

MICROBIOLOGY
___ Blood culture negative x2

___ URINE CULTURE (Final ___:    NO GROWTH. 

___ Urine legionella
Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final ___: 
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN. 
           (Reference Range-Negative). 
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay. 
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other 
L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. 
Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may 
vary.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old ___ speaking woman with h/o CVA c/b residual L 
sided deficit, CAD, HTN, HLD, T2DM, cognitive decline, and B12 
defic anemia, who presented to the ED on ___ with 2 days of 
diarrhea, weakness, and fever, now with intermittent hypoxia and 
tachypnea.   

# Hypoxia/tachypnea:
Overnight on ___, Mrs. ___ developed hypoxia with fever 
to 101.4. DDx includes: CAP, HAP, aspiration PNA, diastolic HF. 
Since beginning presumptive tx for CAP using levofloxacin 750 
Q48h, Mrs. ___ has not spiked a fever. Urine legionella 
antigen and blood cultures negative. Speech and swallow 
evaluated the pt and felt that she was not aspirating to a 
significant degree. They recommended that she was safe to take 
PO pureed solids and thin liquids w/ 1:1 supervision. Initially, 
due to ongoing intermittent hypoxia to 87-88%, she was given 
several doses of furosemide. This did result in increased urine 
output and improvements in her CXR, but due to ___, furosemide 
was discontinued and home lisinopril was held. Renal funcion was 
improving at the time of discharge. She was successfully weaned 
to room air. She will complete a 7 day course of antibiotics for 
community acquired pneumonia.

# Hyponatremia: RESOLVED
Ddx: SIADH vs. reset osmostat. Failure to resolve with fluid 
challenge + urine osm and lytes consistent with SIADH (osm 447, 
UNa = 79). No prior hx of hyponatremia (dating back to ___ 
argues against reset osmostat. Resolved with fluid restriction.

# Diarrhea: RESOLVED
Initially presented with ""large quantities of loose stool"", per 
daughter, but no BMs since ___, small BM on ___. Likely 
symptom of pulmonary infection, though urine legionella antigen 
was negative.
Could also be due to viral gastroenteritis or aggressive home 
bowel regimen (includes 6 meds, given regularly). 

# Somnolence/AMS:  
The pt's alertness and gross MSE is improved since admission. 
Per PCP documentation and discussion with son, pt is at her 
baseline. Multiple negative UAs and culture make UTI unlikely 
cause. TSH wnl. 
  
# DM: Blood sugars consistently in the 200-300s range on lantus 
20u and humalog sliding scale. Home metformin and glipizide held 
while inpatient. Metformin not resumed on discharge given ___ 
during admission.
 
# CAD: ECHO normal. Imdur discontinued as patient cannot take 
whole pills and Imdur cannot be crushed. Replaced with 
Isosorbide Dinitrate TID. Home lisinopril discontuined due to 
___. BP well controlled without lisinopril. Home alodipine, 
aspirin and atorvastatin were continued.

Chronic issues:
# Glaucoma: continued home eye drops, with the exception of 
travaprost, which is not available.

# Hypothyroid: continued home levothyroxine  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
#Diabetes: Poor glycemic control in house. Home meds held, given 
humalog sliding scale, started on lantus, up to 20u qam, still 
with glucose in 200-300 range. Continuing to hold metformin on 
discharge given renal failure. Consider resumption in outpatient 
setting if renal function improves. 
#Hypertension: Lisinopril held for hyperkalemia and renal 
failure. Blood pressure well controlled. Continuing to hold on 
discharge. Consider not restarting if not needed for BP control.
#Dementia - Consider referral to outpatient neurologist for 
neuropsych testing

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with a history of mitral valve and aortic 
valve replacement who presented with worsening dyspnea over 
months and was found to have worsening AI on TTE due to valvular 
leak and planned for outpatient plugging. His hospital course 
was complicated by development of left thigh intramuscular 
hematoma. He was observed and bridged to warfarin. Additionally, 
he was found to have elevated RV impedance and underwent lead 
replacement. 

ACTIVE ISSUES 
=============
# Acute aortic insufficiency 
# Mechanical mitral and aortic vales
# Acute heart failure
Presented with dyspnea requiring BiPap in ED. TTE at OSH showed 
severe 3+ aortic regurgitation. Cardiac surgery and structural 
cardiology were consulted and TEE performed which showed 
moderate aortic regurgitation paravalvularly. Plan was made for 
outpatient percutaneous plugging of paravalvular leak, though 
after discussion with outpatient cardiologist will continue with 
medical optimization for now and defer procedure. Restarted on 
warfarin with heparin bridge while subtherapeutic. D/c INR 2.3, 
D/c Warfarin 5mg, though will require close monitoring.

# Left Thigh Intramuscular Hematoma
Developed acute-onset left thigh pain ___ while walking while 
on heparin gtt bridge awaiting therapeutic INRs. ___ negative 
for DVT. CT with intramuscular hematoma and subcutaneous edema. 
ACS consulted and recommended wrapping leg and holding heparin 
drip. No evidence of compartment syndrome. Heparin initially 
held, then restarted as a bridge to warfarin. INR reached 
therapeutic level and heparin gtt discontinued. Hgb fell, 
transfused for <8, s/p total of 5U pRBC. ACS signed off. 
Hematoma improved substantially prior to discharge. 

# AV block s/p PPM
Patient underwent PPM interrogation and was found to have 
elevated RV lead impedance. He underwent successful lead 
replacement and his PPM was interrogated the next day. Will have 
outpatient device clinic follow=up

# Hyperkalemia

Dear Mr. ___,

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You developed shortness of breath.
- You had an echocardiogram which showed that one of your 
mechanical valves was not working properly.
- You needed an evaluation by the cardiac surgeons.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You were seen by our cardiac surgery team and then our 
interventional cardiology team.
- They recommended that you work on medical management of your 
valve, and if you need a procedure, it will be done outpatient.
- After restarting your blood thinner, you developed a hematoma 
in your thigh.
- We monitored your hematoma and watched as your INR came back 
to an appropriate level.
- Because of the blood you lost into the hematoma in your thigh, 
we gave you blood transfusions.
- While you were here, your pacemaker was evaluated and it was 
found that the lead needed to be replaced. You had a procedure 
done to replace the lead. After this procedure, you were given 
antibiotics to help prevent an infection from developing. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN LEAVE?
- Please take all of your medications as prescribed.
- Please attend all of your follow up appointments as arranged

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure treating you for leg swelling/pain, difficulty 
breathing, and chest pain. You received tests in the emergency 
department which showed you were not having a heart attack, and 
a chest x-ray which did not show pneumonia. 

Your difficulty breathing was likely due to your COPD. You were 
treated with albuterol, Advair, and ipratropium/tiotropium, and 
improved. 

Because you were having increased swelling of your legs, tests 
were done to make sure there was no clots in your legs on lungs. 
An ultrasound of your heart did not reveal a definitive cause. 
The swelling may have been triggered by high salt intake or by 
the steroids you were recently taking. Diuretics (water pills) 
help your body remove excess fluid from the body through the 
urine, which helped you to dramatically decrease the swelling in 
your legs. 

It will be very important for you to begin seeing a primary care 
provider ___. They can help manage your pain medications 
as well as your inhalers and diuretics and assess your pain. 
They can also help organize your healthcare for any other 
issues. Building a relationship with a primary care provider 
___ also reduce your need to be hospitalized and be seen in 
emergency departments.

Please see below for an appointment to establish care at ___ 
___, where your insurance is 
accepted. Please take your medications as prescribed. 

We wish you the best,
Your ___ team

ASSESSMENT/PLAN 
=============== 
___ with h/o schizophrenia, pre-diabetes and GERD presented to
the ED with hypoxia, hypercarbia, and confusion with c/f heart
failure exacerbation found to have RV dysfunction, lung mass, 
PE, and
post-obstructive PNA. 

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
#Acute on chronic hypoxemic hypercarbic respiratory failure 
#PE
#Pneumonia
#Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
Multifactorial given obesity hypoventiliation, also contribution
from PE, PNA seen on CTA, lung mass, and volume overload. Repeat 
BNP
improved s/p diuresis. Trops negative. Remains hypoxemic (high
___ on ___ oxymizer) despite aggressive diuresis, abx, and
anticoagulation, and VBGs have been stable. Had persistent
leukocytosis without fevers while on unasyn for post obstructive
PNA, so broadened to vanc/Zosyn for 7 day course. MRSA swab 
negative on ___ so discontinued vanco. Leukocytosis now 
improved. Patient initially treated with hep gtt, which was 
transitioned to warfarin once confirmed no upcoming procedures. 
Patient was diuresing well with BID doses of Lasix 60mg IV (goal 
net negative 3L) on a low salt diet. Patient took clonidine 
0.2mg qhs to help with claustrophobia while
wearing BiPap. 

# Confusion
# Agitation 
# Schizophrenia
Mental status at presumed baseline, now alert, oriented,
cooperative and appropriate. Back on antipsychotic regimen. 
Patient maintained on olanzapine ___, Depakote 1250mg QHS, 
and clonidine (as above) per psych recs. 

# Transaminitis with synthetic dysfunction: Improved
Most likely etiology was congestive hepatopathy. Given pattern 
of LFTs and severity of right heart failure likely congestive 
hepatopathy. ___ very mildly elevated 1:40, anti-smooth 
negative, non-immune hep b, negative hep c. Patient should be 
vaccinated for hep b. LFTs normalized except elevated LDH, 
despite not appearing to be hemolyzing. 

# Hypothyroidism 
His pattern of mild elevation in TSH with borderline low ft4 can
be seen in subclinical hypothyroidism and nonthyroidal illness,
the latter of which occurs as binding abnormalities result in 
the
appearance of low ft4. His previously in range TSH may support
nonthyroidal illness as more likely cause. Generally, it is
advisable to obtain TSH and ft4 on the same sample. Patient 
should have repeat thyroid function tests in ___ weeks with 
primary care.

# Eye discharge: Improved on erythromycin antibiotic ointment. 

# Anasarca
# ___: Resolved. 
___ resolved with diuresis suggesting cardiorenal syndrome. 
Urine
Na not consistent with intra-renal pathology. Protein/Cr not
consistent with a nephrotic picture.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

It was a pleasure to care for you at the ___ 
___.  

Why did I come to the hospital?  
-  You came to the hospital because you were more tired, 
confused, and your oxygen saturation was very low. 

What happened while I was in the hospital?  
-  You had imaging of your lungs.
-  We gave you a medication to make you urinate and removed a 
lot of extra fluid from your body. You were put on a breathing 
machine (BiPAP) at night.
-  You were also treated with antibitoics to treat a pneumonia.
-  We found a blood clot in the blood vessels going to your 
lungs and started you on a blood thinner.

p/w NSTEMI.  The patient lives in ___ assisted living facility 
where he has a ___ that brings his meds daily and watches him 
take them.  On ___ at ~noon, he was sitting in a chair getting a 
dressing change when he noted a burning chest discomfort, 
radiating to his head, nonpleuritic, nonpositional, not clearly
exertional (though the patient did not exert himself), and not 
associated with dyspnea or palpitations. This persisted for 
___ minutes until he was given TNG x 3 by EMS who was called.  
He was taken to ___ where he was reported to have 
no ECG changes, but had a TnI of 3.  He was admitted, started on 
___, and Toprol and had a TTE done that showed a normal EF 
but
decreased RV function.  He was subsequently sent to ___ for

Discharge Instructions:
 You were admitted for chest pain workup and abnormal blood 
tests.  Your cardiac catheterization revealed that there are no 
blockages in your coronary arteries.

 You had a CT scan of the lungs to look for a blood clot and 
these images were normal.  There is a small nodule in the left 
lung that your primary care doctor ___ need to ___ on.

 The stress on your heart was likely caused by heart failure 
causing extra fluid to build up in the body. We used IV fluid 
and oral medication to take this fluid off, taking stress off of 
your heart.

 It is very important that you weigh yourself every day.  Your 
goal weight is 230 pounds. Please weigh yourself every day in 
the morning after you go to the bathroom and before you get 
dressed. If your weight goes up by more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 
more than 5 lbs in 3 days, please call your heart doctor or your 
primary care doctor and alert them to this change.  

 The following changes have been made to your medications:
-Increase Atorvastatin to 80 mg daily
-Start Lasix 60 mg daily.  
-Start Metoprolol succinate ER 50 mg daily. 
-Start Plavix 75mg daily for ___ year

 It has been a pleasure to have participated in your care. If 
you have any urgent questions that are related to your recovery 
from your procedure or are experiencing any symptoms that are 
concerning to you, please call the ___ heartline at 
___ to speak to a cardiologist or cardiac nurse 
practitioner.

Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization ___
 
History of Present Illness:
___ with history of anxiety, ETOH abuse, who presents with SOB, 
tachycardia, and peripheral edema.

History was obtained from the patient's fiance, ___, 
who is a NP, as pt was unable to provide history. 

She reports that approximately 3.5 wks ago, pt's ex-girlfriend 
began harassing him, causing stress. Pt had frequent panic 
attacks. He developed orthopnea, sleeping in a chair, as well as 
a rapid heart rate that his fiance thought was atrial 
fibrillation, with rates from ___. He also developed a 
productive cough and shortness of breath. Pt attempted to obtain 
visit with his PCP, but was unable to do so. About 10 days ago, 
he developed pedal edema, tachypnea, poor appetite, weakness, 
sleepiness, and ascites. Over this time, he also developed a 
sacral ulcer from lying in bed so much. One day prior to 
admission, he had episodes of confusion.

During this time, his fiance urged him to seek medical care, but 
pt refused. He was still going to work as a ___ during 
most of this time. At baseline, he is quite functional, and 
exercises regularly. Finally today, she was able to convince him 
to come to the ED. 

He drinks 1 bottle of wine daily, and today admitted to ED 
providers that he also drinks nips of vodka. His fiancé states 
she had never seen him drinking the nips and did not perceive 
him to have an alcohol problem. She is not sure how many of 
these he might have been drinking per day. 

He presented to ___. There, he was found to have initial 
vitals:97.4, 130s-140s, 90s/60s, 25, O2 sat low ___ on RA. He 
was given 2L IVF, diltiazem 10mg x 2, Ativan 1mg, vancomycin, 
and zosyn. He became hypotensive and was started on levophed. 
Labs were notable for hepatic and renal failure, hyponatremia, 
and leukocytosis. He was transferred to ___ for further 
management.

 In the ED, initial vitals: 96.9  130  ___  98% Nasal 
Cannula 
 Labs notable for:  WBC 15.2 w/ 80% PMNs, BUN/Cr 93/1.4, Tb 6.6 
(5.3 direct), INR 1.6, ALT 386, AST 272. Lipase 157. Na 118. 
ETOH level 82. BNP 2937. VBG: 7.4/29, bicarb 13, lactate 2.9. 
 Imaging: CXR showing pulmonary edema and right pleural 
effusion, RUQ US showing cirrhosis, small ascites. CT head with 
no acute changes. 
 Pt was given: diazepam 5mg IV, levophed was changed to 
dobutamine, thiamine 500mg IV, folate 1mg IV, and loading dose 
phenobarb 780mg.
 A left femoral CVL was placed. 
 Pt was evaluated by hepatology and cardiology. Given his 
ongoing afib with RVR, dobutamine was stopped, with stable 
pressures thereafter. The cardiology fellow performed a bedside 
ultrasound showing global hypokinesis of LV, with depressed EF.

 On transfer, vitals were: 126  ___  99% Nasal Cannula  

 On arrival to the MICU, pt is sometimes sleepy, sometimes 
agitated and pulling at lines/tubes. He responds to questions 
intermittently. He denies chest pain, abdominal pain. He 
endorses discomfort at the site of the foley catheter.

contractility.  PA line removed ___ (last of numbers: CO 6.0 CI 
2.8 SVR 522, lactate 1, MVO2 69). PICC was placed and pt 
discharged on milrinone with a plan to re-admit in several weeks 
to attempt wean.  Also discharged on Digoxin, Lisinopril and 
Spironolactone.  Discharge diuretic regimen ????  Discharge 
weight ????  
 
#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION W/ RVR: 
Pt found to have newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation with RVR.  
CHADS2 score 1 (for CHF).  RVR likely triggered by alcohol 
abuse.  Pt cardioverted with TEE on ___ but returned to ___ 
fibrillation later in the day, likely secondary to levophed 
(which was later discontinued).  Pt was successfully 
cardioverted with amiodarone and remained in sinus rhythm for 
the rest of the hospitalization. During hospitalization, pt 
anticoagulated with heparin gtt, and transitioned to Apixaban on 
___. Pt discharged on amiodarone 200mg daily (reduced on ___ 
after loading dose. 
 
#) DECOMPENSATED LIVER DISEASE
Pt found to have newly diagnosed liver disease, likely secondary 
to alcoholic hepatitis and congestive hepatopathy in setting of 
poor cardiac function. On admission, MELD score 22. Discriminant 
function 27.3, so he did not meet criteria for steroids.  Duplex 
RUQUS showed echogenic liver consistent with steatotis with 
patent hepatic vasculature and small volume ascites.  The most 
likely etiology of his liver disease is alcohol.  Liver function 
tests were downtrending with improving cardiac function.  Pt to 
follow up with hepatology for EGD for esophageal varices 
screening.

#HYPONATREMIA:
Pt found to have severe hyponatremia with Na 118 on 
presentation.  Sodium corrected rapidly with aggressive 
diuresis, controlled with free water boluses.  Resolved on 
discharge. 

#ETOH withdrawal: 
Last drink on day of admission, ETOH level on admit 82. Pt high 
risk for complicated withdrawal given withdrawal sx with 
positive ETOH level. He was loaded with phenobarbital in the ED. 
Later managed with CIWA protocol with ativan.  Pt received 
thiamine, folate and MVI.
 
#E. COLI UTI 
Pt found to have pan-sensitive E. coli UTI, for which he 
completed a 7-day course of Ceftriaxone.
 
#HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: 
Patient was electively intubated for mechanical support during 
procedures and cardioversion.  Pt developed hypoxia to 84% while 
impella placed, possibly secondary to flash pulmonary edema.  Pt 
was successfully diuresed and extubated.
 
#ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:
Unknown baseline.  Creatinine 1.4 on admission, peaked at 2.1.  
Urine sediment showed muddy brown casts, consistent with ATN 
likely from hypotension in setting of cardiogenic shock.  
Creatinine resolved with improving cardiac function and 
diuresis.  Resolved on discharge.
 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
================================ 
1. Pt discharged with PICC in place for home Milrinone. Plan to 
re-admit pt in several weeks to attempt weaning Milrinone.
2. Pt will need to be involved in alcohol relapse prevention 
program.
3. Pt will need EGD for esophageal varices screening. Pt 
scheduled for follow-up with hepatology.
4. Pt discharged on amiodarone 200 daily 
5. Pt discharged with Ativan for anxiety, however, this should 
be managed by mental health provider. He needs referral to 
psychiatry/psychologist for this. Would likely benefit from 
SSRI.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  You were admitted 
because of your recent shortness of breath, leg swelling, and 
rapid heart rate.  You were found to have a very sick heart, 
likely from alcohol.  You required medications to help support 
your heart.  

Your heart is still very weak, so you need to continue 
milrinone, which is the infusion to help support your heart.  We 
are hoping to re-admit you to the hospital in several weeks to 
attempt weaning the milrinone.  

You were also found to have liver disease, which is also likely 
from alcohol.  You have follow-up scheduled with a liver doctor. 
 

You were also found to have an abnormal rhythm of your heart 
(atrial fibrillation).  This abnormal rhythm can cause strokes, 
so you were started on a blood thinner called Apixaban to 
prevent strokes.

You were started on many new medications.  It is very important 
for you to take these medications as prescribed.  It is very 
important for you to weigh yourself every morning, and call your 
doctor if your weight goes up by more than 3 pounds or you start 
to have more swelling in your legs. You may have to take an 
extra dose of torsemide if your weight goes up. You should do 
this as directed by your cardiologist. You should also return 
immediately if you develop worsening shortness of breath or 
chest pain.

Most importantly, it is VERY important that you avoid alcohol, 
as this can cause further damage to your heart.

Sincerely,
Your ___ team

CXR ___
Right-sided AICD and pacemaker device is noted 
with lead terminating in the right ventricle. Abandoned pacer 
leads are also noted within the left chest wall. The patient is 
status post median 
sternotomy and CABG. The heart is mildly enlarged. There is new 
perihilar 
haziness with vascular indistinctness compatible with pulmonary 
edema.  
Additionally, more focal opacities within both lung bases likely 
reflect 
atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded. There are small 
bilateral 
pleural effusions, right greater than left. No pneumothorax is 
present. 
IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure, new in the interval, 
with 
bibasilar airspace opacities, likely atelectasis, but infection 
is not 
excluded. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 
.
Echo ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size 
are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal and mid 
inferoseptal, inferior, and inferolateral walls. There is 
considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular 
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. 
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free 
wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction as described above with beat-to-beat variability in 
left ventricular systolic ejection fraction. Mild mitral 
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. At least 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the overall right ventricular systolic function appears to have 
improved and the severity of pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension has increased. 
.
CT Chest ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Smooth septal thickening and ground glass opacity in 
dependent 
distribution, which gives a crazy paving appearance and likely 
reflects 
pulmonary edema in this patient with a significant ischemic 
cardiomyopathy, although pulmonary hemorrhage, and aspiration 
(e.g. lipoid pneumonia) are possible in the appropriate clinical 
settings. More confluent peribronchial consolidation in left 
lower lobe could be due to same process, but raises concern for 
infection.  
2. Mild-to-moderate centrilobular emphysema. The presence of 
pulmonary 
arterial enlargement suggests pulmonary hypertension. 
3. Bilateral mild to moderately large pleural effusions with 
associated 
compressive atelectasis. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Fr. ___ is an ___ gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, ___ with EF 
30%, uderlying AF but s/p pacemaker/ICD with recent generator 
change who presents with Sx of fatigue and SOB with picture 
concerning for acute sCHF exacerbation.  
.  
# CORONARIES: Known CAD, s/p MI and CABG in ___. Trops/CKs 
flat, ruled out for acute MI. Home statin and ___ were 
continued. Pt became orthostatic on HD 2, and ___ was 
decreased, but was subsequently uptitrated to home dose. ASA 
81mg was started as was not on patient's med list. Pt's PCP was 
contacted and in agreement that ___ should be on ASA.  
.  
# PUMP: EF 30% in ___. Presentation was felt to be acute on 
chronic systolic heart failure given significantly elevated BNP 
on admission, bibasilar crackles, and CXR findings. Echo this 
admission was improved with EF 40%. Pt was gently diuresed. Pt 
became orthostatic on HD2 as noted above, likely from diuresis 
plus high-dose anti-hypertensives, but his ___ and ___ were 
able to be uptitrated back to home dose prior to d/c. Diuresis 
was held as Cr began to slowly rise, and pt was not sent home on 
oral diuresis. 
.
He saturated well on room are both at rest and with ambulation. 
.  
# RHYTHM: AF, chronic. Con't home digoxin and ___ as noted 
above. Pt paced at 60. Pt has not been therapeutic on warfarin. 
CHADS2 score of 5, so most of his admission was on a heparin gtt 
bridge to coumadin. Warfarin dose was continually increased 
without achieving a therapeutic INR. Dabigatran was discussed, 
but was not covered by the patient's insurance. However, it may 
be worthwhile to try to get a prior authorization as would be a 
better drug for this patient. The decision was made to hold pt's 
anticoagulation for a month given hemoptysis (see below).
.
# Hemoptysis: Chronic (per pt ___ years), but per last 2 PCPs, had 
not been worked up previosly. Given extensive smoking Hx and 
small nodules noted on prior xrays, CT chest was done which 
showed B/L effusions and ground glass opacities. Pulmonology was 
consulted, and felt CHF was likely the primary etiology. Pt was 
covered for CAP with a course of levofloxacin per their recs. 
Urine legionella was negative, and sputum Cx pending. Pt has 
pulm follow-up scheduled as an outpatient.    
PPI started and speech and swallow consulted re GERD/?aspiration 
who did note some swallowing abnormalities, but not to a severe 
degree, and risks/benefits were discussed with pt. 
.
___ recommended checking ___, ANCA, and anti-GBM, which were 
pending at the time of discharge. It would be useful to get 
imaging studies from ___, but patient did not recall where 
these had been done. 
Coumadin held upon discharge as noted above.       
.  
# HTN: Metoprolol and valsartan as above. Home antihypertensive 
regimen was reuptitrated after briefy orthostatic hypoTN episode 
early in hospital course, after which, pt was hypertense to 
160-170's. 
.  
# s/p pacemaker intervention: Pt completed a course of 
cephalexin 500mg BID for prophylaxsis after pacer wire revision. 
Sx started chronologically with pacer intervention, so EP saw 
the patient in the ___. Pacer was successfully interrogated. UCx 
negative, BCx had not growth to date at the time of discharge.
.
.
Pt was confirmed full code this admission.   
.
Of note, pt's PCP ___ was contacted and given a verbal 
signout of active issues and interventions done this admission, 
including need to f/u elevated Cr, pt discharged off Lasix, and 
hemoptysis issues.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
 
It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___. You were 
admitted to the hospital for worsening shortness of breath with 
exertion. We think this is due to your know heart problem called 
cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure.  It is very likely 
that this condition is related to cocaine use, so we would 
recommend that you stop using cocaine.
 
We started you on a medication called spironolactone, which you 
should continue as prescribed. It is also very important that 
you continue your lasix so fluid does not build up.

.
CXR ___: Compared to the previous radiograph, there is an 
increase in 
severity of the bilateral parenchymal opacities, with newly 
appeared 
consolidations in the retrocardiac lung areas that are likely 
atelectatic in nature.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is 
unchanged.  No pneumothorax.

.
CXR ___: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a 
mild decrease in extent and severity of the pre-existing 
parenchymal opacities.  The heart continues to be large.  There 
is ongoing blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the 
presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of Type II 
diabetes (DMII) complicated by neuropathy, hypertension, 
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome complicated by stroke in 
___, chronic right foot osteomyelitis w/ recent debridement who 
presented with 4d of fatigue, tightness of abdomen and 
increasing lower extremity edema, found to have a heart failure 
exacerbation.
.  
# Acute diastolic heart failure (dCHF): His prior echo in ___ showed LVEF >55% so CHF is likely diastolic in nature. 
Trigger for exacerbation could be medication noncompliance 
leading to volume overload and hypertension, especially since 
the patient admitted that he frequently self-dosed his blood 
pressure medications.  Patchy opacities on CXR were suggestive 
of pneumonia, so pt was treated for this initially with 
levofloxacin, vancomycin, cefepime. Initial cardiac enzymes were 
negative, and pt also had a recent stress test that was 
negative.  PE was also considered given patient's history of 
antiphospholipid syndrome. His WELLS score for PE was 1.5, which 
is a low probability. He had no pleuritic signs or clinical 
symptoms of DVT. Nonetheless, obtained ___ dopplers which were 
neg for DVT bilaterally. Pt was aggressively diuresed with IV 
lasix drip and his pulm edema and oxygenation improved. The 
patchy opacities that were read as possible pneumonia also 
improved, making this diagnosis unlikely. Other infectious work 
up neg, including blood and urine cx and urine legionella ag.  
Antibiotics were stopped on hospital day 4 due to low suspicion 
for pneumonia.  He was maintained on an IV nitroglycerin drip to 
keep his SBP between 110-140 while in the ICU and then 
transitioned to an oral regimen. On discharge, his medication 
regimen consisted of torsemide 20mg daily, lisinopril 40mg 
daily, amlodipine 10mg and carvedilol 12.5mg bid. He was 
continued on ___ 81mg daily and pravastatin 40 mg daily.
.
# Hypertension: pt hypertensive on admission with SBP 160s-170s. 
Patient has not been taking medications for > 3 days.  He was 
placed on nitro drip to keep pressures down. He was restarted on 
his home meds of amlodipine and lisinopril. His atenolol was 
changed to carvedilol for better control of BP as well as beta 
blockade for heart failure.  His medications were titrated as 
needed and on discharge his regimen consisted of torsemide 20mg 
daily, lisinopril 40mg daily, amlodipine 10mg and carvedilol 
12.5mg bid.
.
# Orthostatic hypotension: Patient was orthostatic the last 2 
days of his admission and his creatinine on the day of discharge 
was up to 1.7 from 0.9 on admission.  It was felt that he was 
overdiuresed with torsemide during the admission.  Please 
recheck Cr at follow-up and adjust his dose of torsemide as 
needed to avoid overdiuresis.  
.  
# DMII: Patient w/ longstanding DMII (___), complicated by 
peripheral neuropathy, stroke, gastroparesis, autonomic 
neuropathy. Patient on lantus 52 qhs, and novolog pre-breakfast, 
lunch and dinner. Patient had not been taking insulin for the 
past three days on admission. Glucose level 222 in ED.  He was 
restarted on insulin glargine with insulin humalog sliding scale 
while in house.
.      
# Anti-phospholipid Syndrome: Has history of stroke. INR 
subtherapeutic at 1.4 on admission; had not taken coumadin for 
last 4 days. High risk for thrombus formation, so bridged with 
heparin to coumadin and restarted pt on coumadin and adjusted 
dose as indicated. On discharge, coumadin dose was 7 mg daily 
and INR was 2.7. 
 . 
# Chronic osteomyelitis: Patient was on Keflex PO q6h as 
outpatient, but was started on Cefepime as above for HCAP so 
Keflex was held initially. Due to low suspicion for pneumonia, 
cefepime was stopped and he was placed back on keflex. He 
completed his course prior to discharge.  Has follow-up 
scheduled with ID outpatient.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please assist with diet teaching for heart failure, ie. low 
salt and medication compliance.  Please help weigh him every day 
and call ___ MD if his weight goes up more than 3 lbs
- Please monitor INR, goal is ___ for antiphospholipid syndrome, 
life-long
- Please recheck Cr at follow-up and adjust his dose of 
torsemide as needed to avoid overdiuresis.

STUDIES:
=========
CXR ___
Bibasilar and right perihilar opacity is new and concerning for 
pneumonia. Mild fluid overload. 

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:    
Heart size is enlarged.  Mediastinum is stable.  There is 
interval increase in perihilar opacities concerning for 
progression of pulmonary edema.  In addition right basal 
consolidation is even more conspicuous concerning for infectious 
process.  Bilateral pleural effusion is noted 

CXR ___
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little 
overall change.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac 
silhouette with pulmonary edema that appears less prominent than 
on the previous study.  At the right base, there is increased 
opacification with suggestion of air bronchograms, concerning 
for superimposed pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusions with 
compressive basilar atelectasis again seen. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ 
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior and 
inferoseptal as well as mid inferior hypo/akinesis. Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters are most consistent 
with Grade III/IV (severe) left ventricular diastolic 
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic 
arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: 
1) Mild regional left ventricular systolic function suggestive 
of CAD in the RCA distribution. Global LV systolic function is 
preserved. 
2) Restrictive filling pattern with likely elevated LVEDP 
causing mild to moderate pulmonary systolic arterial 
hypertension in the setting of normal RV size and function. 
 The patient has a mildly dilated ascending aorta. Based on ___ 
ACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic Guidelines, if not previously known or 
a change, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in ___ year; if 
previously known and stable, a follow-up echocardiogram is 
suggested in ___ years. 
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
regional wall motion abnormalities are new and diastolic 
dysfunction has worsened.  

ECG ___: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. 
There is a slightly leftward axis. There are non-specific ST-T 
wave abnormalities. Compared
to tracing #1 shows new atrial fibrillation.

VEIN MAPPING ___: IMPRESSION:  
Chronically thrombosed aneurysmal cephalic vein AV fistula.
Otherwise the bilateral cephalic and basilic veins are patent 
with diameters
above.
Mild calcifications of the bilateral radial arteries.
Duplicated left brachial artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman s/p renal transplant in ___ 
with chronic humoral rejection and allograft dysfunction (recent 
creatinine 5.7), chronic anemia, and hypertension who presented 
with increased fatigue and dyspnea, found to have multifocal 
pneumonia and new onset paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, dCHF 
exacerbation and worsening renal function.

#PNA: Ms. ___ initially presented with subjective fevers, 
cough, leukocytosis and tachycardia, as well as CXR with 
bibasilar and right perihilar opacity concerning for infection, 
consistent with pneumonia. Patient was initially started on 
vancomycin/cefepime but was switched to azithromycin and 
ceftriaxone on ___ for more appropriate CAP coverage. Her urine 
Strep pneumo and Legionella were negative for infection, and 
blood cultures were negative to date. She completed azithromycin 
x5d and 5d ceftriaxone. Repeat CXR showed stable opacity. 
Patient was switched to po levofloxacin at discharge for a total 
of 10 day course.

#pAfib with RVR: newly diagnosed this hospitalization, but may 
have been occurring for the past ___ months. CHADS-VASC score =3 
thus may benefit from anticoagulation. Given renal failure, she 
is only a candidate for warfarin, which was held at this time 
pending fistula placement by Transplant surgery. Patient is 
discharged in NSR on 150 mg metoprolol XL BID for rate control. 

#dCHF exacerbation: BNP>70,000 but in setting of CKD and fluid 
overload. Presented with chest pain and increased pulmonary 
edema, but improved with diuresis. Responds to 160 iv lasix, 
receiving it in boluses. TTE ___ w/ worsening dCHF and mild 
regional wall motion abnormality despite flat trops and no 
consistent ECG changes. She was transitioned to home regimen of 
80 mg furosemide BID once near euvolemia.

# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Cr prior to admission 5.7 due 
to chronic transplant humoral rejection and allograft 
dysfunction, with planned outpatient initiation of HD. Of note, 
her diuretics have been increased recently due to worsening 
volume overload, with a rise in her creatinine. Creatinine in 
high 7s range this hospitalization, likely secondary to 
infection. Improved from 7.9 to 7.1 on discharge with treatment 
of infection and with diuresis. For her CKD, patient was 
continued on a calcitriol; sevelamer was also started. Vein 
mapping was completed to facilitate planning for fistula 
placement in the near future.

# S/p Renal transplant with chronic humoral rejection and 
allograft dysfunction: Her home azathioprine was held in the 
setting of acute infection. She was continued on cyclosporine 
and prednisone. Cyclosporine levels were high this 
hospitalization, thus dosing was decreased to 50 mg BID.

# Anemia: Admission H/H of 6.___.4, down from a baseline of 
7.2. Received pRBC transfusions prn for Hgb>7.

# Hypertension: continued home metoprolol, but increased to 150 
mg BID. continued amlodipine

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!

Why were you hospitalized?
- Because you were experiencing fevers and feeling unwell at 
home.

What was done for you this hospitalization?
-You were found to have a pneumonia, for which you received 
antibiotics. You were treated with antibiotics for it through 
the IV. You will need a few more days of oral antibiotics at 
home.
-You developed an abnormal heart rhythm called 'atrial 
fibrillation' or 'afib' while in the hospital with very fast 
heart rates. We managed it by giving you a medication called 
metoprolol (which you take at home) in higher doses. Your heart 
switched back to a normal rhythm by discharge.
-You developed shortness of breath and fluid overload because of 
the stress on your heart with the infection and your chronic 
kidney disease. We gave you more water pills through the iv to 
help you get rid of the fluid. You required oxygen for some 
time, but improved.
-Your kidney function got worse because of the infection you 
were having, but improved a little by the time of discharge with 
water pills and treatment of the infection.
-We did a vein mapping study for when you need to have a fistula 
placed.

What should you do after you leave the hospital?
-Complete your antibiotic course
-Follow up with transplant surgery about placing a fistula.
-We started several more medication that protect the heart which 
you will need to take. 
-You may also need more testing for your heart after you leave 
the hospital.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old woman with past medical history of sarcoid 
disease, PA hypertension, and OSA who presents with two weeks of 
worsening dyspnea on exertion. She reports that at baseline she 
will use 2L at rest though recently had been able to take this 
off for short periods. She will put on 4L for ambulation as 
minimal as walking across a room. Over the past two weeks, 
however, this has progressively been worsening so that she never 
takes off her supplementary oxygen and is occasionally bumping 
her oxygen up to 6 L by nasal cannula at home when ambulating. 
Occasional mild righ sided sharp chest pain that lasts a few 
seconds. Not associated w/ exertion or cough. Patient unable to 
elaborate more. She denies any increased cough. No fevers, 
chills, or night sweats. No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any 
abdominal symptoms. She denies orthopnea or PND. She endorses 
occasional lower extremity edema but this has not changes 
recently. Of note, she is on chronic prednisone and MTX therapy 
for her sarcoid. She stopped taking her atovaquone four weeks 
ago due to cost. She contacted the pulmonary clinic today to 
discuss these symptoms and was instructed to come to the ED.  
.
 
In the ED VS T 98.2, P 86, BP 140/63, RR 18, O2 Sat 95% on 2L. 
She got one dose of atovaquone and a CT scan that showed ground 
glass and septal thickening R>L more consistent with sarcoid. 
Pulmonary was called and they said they would follow in house 
and likely bronch tomorrow.  

. 
Currently, she denies any chest pain, fevers, or chills. Reports 
some continued dyspnea but no other acute complaints.

Imaging:
___ CT chest: 
1. Interval increase in ground-glass opacity of the right lung, 
with 
peribronchovascular thickening and ground-glass opacities, 
appearance and 
distribution similar to previous studies and most consistent 
with progression of known sarcoid. 
2. Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery suggestive of, 
although not 
diagnostic of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
3. Unchanged small pericardial effusion. 
___ CXR: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were 
obtained. Bilateral interstitial opacities are again seen, 
increased diffusely on the right.  Findings may be due to 
asymmetric progression of sarcoid, although an overlying, 
superimposed infectious process is not excluded. Findings are 
less likely due to asymmetric edema. No pleural effusion is 
seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with 
mild cardiomegaly again seen.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with history of stage IV pulmonary sarcoid as 
well as pulmonary hypertension and chronic immunosuppressive 
therapy presenting with worsened dyspnea on exertion in the 
context of stopping her PCP prophylaxis four weeks ago.  

1) Dyspnea on exertion/Hypoxia: Given chest CT most likely 
diagnosis is sarcoid flair. Pulmonary was consulted during this 
admission and performed a bronchoscopy. BAL was PCP negative and 
did not show any bacteria on gram stain. Giver her subacute 
presentation, lack of tachycardia on exam, no EKG changes, and 
improvement with steroids, it was thought that PE was very 
unlikely and the patient did not get a CTA. Patient was treated 
with an increased dose of Prednisone. She will continue of 40mg 
po qday until her pulmonologist instructs her otherwise. She was 
restarted on her Mepron and will continue her outpatient dose of 
methotrexate.  
.  
2) Pulmonary artery hypertension: Patient is currently off 
sildenafil. Recommend outpatient workup for further managment. 
This was not an acute issue during this admission. 
. 
3) Chronic diastolic CHF: Continued patient's daily Lasix. 
.  
4) Osteoarthritis/Chronic knee pain: Continue home tramadol and 
tylenol

There are no radiopaque foreign bodies overlying the orbits. 

MRI L ANKLE ___
1.  Skin ulcer, subcutaneous edema and skin thickening, which 
can represent cellulitis ___ the appropriate clinical setting.  
No rim enhancing fluid collection.  No osteomyelitis.
2.  Mild tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon.

MRI R FOOT WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST ___
IMPRESSION: 
 
1.  Synovial hypertrophy and proliferation with periarticular 
erosions seen atthe first MTP joint most likely represent gout 
or inflammatory arthritis suchas rheumatoid.  Infection is a 
possibility but given the lack of bone marrow edema pattern and 
significant joint effusion they are considered less likely. 
Secondary degenerative changes are seen at the first MTP joint.
 
2.  Skin ulcer and soft tissue edema noted without evidence of 
abscess or
osteomyelitis at the third toe.   There is a small amount of 
fluid at the
third MTP joint, however, given the lack of bone marrow edema 
infection/
septic arthritis is considered unlikely.
 
3.  Degenerative changes ___ subchondral cysts versus possibly 
erosions are
seen at multiple TMT joints.

___ ART EXT (REST ONLY)
FINDINGS:   
On the right side, triphasic Doppler waveforms are seen ___ the  
posterior 
tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. 
The right ABI was not obtained due to noncompressible arteries. 
  
On the left side, triphasic Doppler waveforms are seen at the 
left  posterior 
tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. 
The left ABI was not obtained due to noncompressible arteries. 
  
Pulse volume recordings showed symmetric amplitudes bilaterally, 
at all 
levels.  There were slightly diminished at the metatarsal area 
  
Toe pressures were 132/101 mm Hg consistent with calcified toe 
vessels. 
  
IMPRESSION:   
Triphasic waveforms suggest adequate perfusion to feet.  
Evidence of medial calcification. 

MICROBIOLOGY: 
Urine culture ___: Negative
Blood cultures ___ and ___: Negative

___ SWAB  R ___ TOE. 

   GRAM STAIN (Final ___: 
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR

      SMEAR REVIEWED; RESULTS CONFIRMED. 

   WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary): 
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA. 
         This culture contains mixed bacterial types (>=3) so an
         abbreviated workup is performed. Any growth of 
P.aeruginosa,
         S.aureus and beta hemolytic streptococci will be 
reported. IF
         THESE BACTERIA ARE NOT REPORTED, THEY ARE NOT PRESENT

      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    SPARSE GROWTH.  OF TWO COLONIAL 
MORPHOLOGIES. 

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary): 
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA. 
         Mixed bacteria are present, which may include anaerobes 
and/or facultative anaerobes. The presence of B.fragilis, 
C.perfringens, and C.septicum is being ruled out.

hyperlipidemia, and long hospitalization ___ ___ for severe 
sepsis resulting ___ speech difficulties from intubation 
presented with shaking chills, found to have sepsis, 
bradycardia, and hypotension, transferred to ___ for further 
care, with inital plan for pacemaker placement after infection 
resolved which was deferred as patient's bradycardia was 
assymptomatic and thought to be patient's baseline.

# Atrial Fibrillation with Slow Conduction: Patient's EKG was 
irregular with slow heart rate and no discernible p waves, which 
___ the setting of chronic atrial fibrillation suggests slow 
conduction and AV node dysfunction. His heart rate did not 
augment with bedside exercises. As recently as ___, he had 
RBBB on EKG and now the pt has LBBB. It does not appear to be 
rate dependent as he previously had EKGs read as RBBB with rate 
___ the ___ (no actual EKG available for comparison). Given 
history of bundle branch block, he likely had extensive 
conduction disease. Currently no need for any acute intervention 
for heart rate given that he was mentating appropriately with 
good urine output and normal lactate, pt was w/o LH/dizziness or 
any Sx from the bradycardia. It is also possible that his 
bradycardia was due to his infection/possible sepsis. EP 
considered placing pacemaker once infxn clears however decided 
against it given that patient was assyptomatic and likely at 
baseline HR. Pt's TSH was wnl. Held metoprolol and other 
arrythmics while bradycardia, no need for chronotropic agents as 
pt w/o difficulty perfusing. Pt's AC was held initially ___ the 
setting of possible interventions, was restarted on his home 
Warfarin.

# Soft tissue infection of R extremity third phalynx: Initially 
there was concern for septic shock with pt's hypotension, but 
most likely etiology for low BPs was his bradycardia. 
Hypotension improved with fluids. Most likely source was his 
foot infection, R toe vs L ankle ulcer.There was no report of 
infiltrate on chest x-ray and no history of cough. He had no 
dysuria and UA at ___ was normal. He reports no other 
localizing symptoms other than his ___ ulcers which weren't 
painful, ___ ankle wound Cx grew MRSA, blood cultures 
from ___ have been negative. UA was found to be positive for 
nitrites. Initially there was concern for endocarditis due to 
bradycardia, TTE/TEE not showing endocarditis. ID was consulted 
for recommendations. MRI was done which was negative for 
osteomyelitis. ESR/CRP was mildly elevated. UCx was negative. 
Skin flora from patient's toe ulcer was growing polymicrobial 
species. Pt was covered broadly for skin flora with Vancomycin 
for MRSA and ceftriaxone for Strep species, and was narrowed to 
bactrim and flagyl. Vasular surgery was consulted for ankle 
ulcer, noninvasives showed good arterial waveforms, most likely 
venous stasis ulcer, recommended raising legs and compression 
ACE wraps, no angiography needed. Podiatry was consulted for toe 
ulcer, for which they debrided, toe xrays did not appear to show 
osteo and wound didn't appear to go to bone. ID recommended 1 
week Abx for soft tissue infection as MRI was negative for 
osteo. 7 day course of antibiotics, end date ___.

# Diastolic Heart Failure: Pt w/o signs of acute decompensated 
heart failure. He was slightly hypoxic with mild pulmonary 
congestion reported by ___. Pt w/increasing ___ edema, TTE 
here w/normal EF. Restarted pt's home Lasix 40mg BID.

# ___ on CKD: Patient's baseline Cr appeared to be around 
1.3-1.5. Cr 1.4 on discharge. 

# Troponinemia: Most likely caused by sepsis/demand and 
elevation ___ the setting of chronic kidney disease. No elevation 
___ CK-MB and no signs of ST segment changes. TTE w/o regional 
wall abnormality. RESOLVED.

# Transaminitis: Low grade to ___, stable. ___ be ___ to 
ceftriaxone or ___ to transient hypotensive state given elevated 
lactate during admission that has since resolved. Ceftriaxone 
discontinued. No RUQ pain.

# Hematuria: Patient with hematuria that appeared to be due to 
Foley trauma ___ the setting of being on warfarin. Had improved 
though again w/hematuria ___ AM, though only w/few clots ___, 
NO CBI was needed, DC'd foley. RESOLVED.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Hypertension: Held lisinopril 10mg daily while hypotensive and 
re-started.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin 40mg daily.
# BPH: Continued tamsulosin 0.4mg and finasteride 5mg daily.
# Insomnia: Held zolpidem 5mg PRN initially but re-started at 
2.5mg PRN at patient/family's request.

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES***
-No Metoprolol or anti-arrythmics while pt is bradycardic, as 
they can cause asystole due to preventing escape rhythm
-consider increasing Lasix dose to decrease ___ edema
-No angio or intervention per vascular for left ankle ulcer
-Repeat LFTs at primary care appointment as an out patient to 
ensure resolution of mild transaminitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ cardiac catheterization
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a history of CAD s/p CABG x 
3 (SVG to LAD, SVG to D1 and SVG to PDA), also s/p PCIs, 
hypertension, sCHF, AAA and thoracic aortic aneurysm, and 
prostate cancer who was admitted to an OSH a week ago with 
dyspnea.  He was found to have pneumonia and was treated with 
antibiotics.  He was readmitted on ___ with recurrent 
dyspnea, chest pain, back pain, and nausea.  EKG reportedly 
showed ST depressions.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled and 
troponins peaked at 0.64.  
.
Per his wife/HCP, he has not ""felt himself"" for the past few 
months.  he has been in cardiac rehab but has been getting more 
tired than usual.  Feeling tired easily, started having back 
pain.  Went to the OSH ED and was found to have PNA for which he 
was treated with Azithromycin and he was sent home.  The next 
day, he was still restless, with chest discomfort and trouble 
breathing despite using O2 (usually just uses it at night with 
his CPAP).  He went to the OSH ED again and he was thought to 
have a COPD exacerbation.  However, 2 days into his admission he 
continued to have back pain which radiated to the front and was 
found to have troponins 
___.  An echo that had 
been done on ___ showed a dilated LV with an EF of 35%.  Per 
the outside report his LV size had increased from his echo in 
___ and he had moderate to severe MR with posterior leaflet 
restriction, significant AI, and his known ascending aortic 
aneurysm.  Chest CT on ___ showed COPD, the thoracic aneurysm, 
and mild bilateral pleural effusions.  He has been in atrial 
fibrillation during his admission, but then spontaneously 
converted to sinus rhythm today.  He has been on a heaprin gtt 
since admission as well as an integrillin gtt and nitro gtt.  He 
is being transferred for possible cardiac catheterization.  On 
the night prior to transfer, he had chest pain which required 
initiation of Integrillin drip.  Vital signs upon transfer were 
BP 100/50, HR 63.
.  
On arrival to the floor, patient is having chest pain, ___ 
and he has been in pain for the whole ambulance ride.  He says 
he has been having chest pain intermittently all day, requiring 
2 doses of Morphine that resolved his pain temporarily.  His O2 
sat was in the 80's and he has been put on supplemental O2.  He 
says that at home he uses o2 occasionally for shortness of 
breath, which he has felt more frequently recently.  otherwise, 
he usually just uses it at night with his CPAP.
.  
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black 
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. 
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other 
review of systems were negative.  
.  
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal 
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope 
or presyncope.

___________________________________________
___________________________________________

TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM (OSH) ___:
1. Patient was quite uncomfortable lying on his left side and 
despite multiple breaks, he decided to terminate the exam before 
it was desired by the sonographer.
2. Dilated LV with akinesis of inferior wall and LVEF ~35%. LV 
has increased in size from TTE on ___, measuring 5.8cm at 
that time (6.4cm in diastole now).  
3. Moderate to severe MR with posterior leaflet restriction 
secondary to inferior ___ ischemia/infarction.
4. Significant aortic insufficiency; unable to completely 
assess.  It was previously noted as severe.
5. Ascending TAA; unable to measure on 2D on this or the 
previous occasion.
6. Decreased RV systolic function.
.
CT CHEST (OSH) ___
1. s/p sternotomy
2. cardiomegaly
3. TAA (unchanged, 6.7-6.8cm)
4. COPD
5. mild bilateral pleural effusion, mild bibasilar 
atelectasis/residual infiltrate, overall improved since ___.
.
EKG ___
Artifact is present. Probable sinus rhythm. Ventricular ectopy. 
There is
a non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. There are Q 
waves in the
inferior leads with ST segment elevations and terminal T wave 
inversions
consistent with acute or evolving infarction. Additional 
non-specific
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ 
ST segment
elevation is more prominent. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
CXR ___
IMPRESSION:
AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph here 
___:
Mild pulmonary edema is present. Opacification in the left 
infrahilar lung is identical to the appearance in ___ and 
therefore unlikely to be acute
pneumonia. It is probably chronic atelectasis due to the 
adjacent enlargement of both the tortuous descending thoracic 
aorta and left heart. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. No 
pneumothorax.
.
CXR ___
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to ___:
Greater opacification primarily in the left lung surrounding the 
hilus, but
also on the right, accompanied by slight increase in mediastinal 
venous
engorgement, in the setting of large heart is probably due to 
worsening
pulmonary edema. Left lower lobe consolidation is chronic, 
probably
atelectasis, but right infrahilar consolidation developed 
between ___ and ___ and is concerning for pneumonia.
.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ___

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ gentleman with known CAD who was 
transferred with NSTEMI: he had EKG changes in the setting of 
troponin leak.  He underwent cardiac catheterization which 
showed no lesions that would be amenable to intervention.  His 
course was complicated by hypoxia that was likely due to CHF 
exacerbation as well as recovery from a recent pneumonia. 
.
#. Chest pain/Coronary artery disease: NSTEMI. He presented with 
recurrent dyspnea, chest pain, back pain, and nausea.  He was 
transferred to ___ on a Heparin gtt as well as Nitro gtt and 
Integrillin gtt due to ongoing chest pain at OSH.  He had Q 
waves in the inferior leads with ST segment elevations and 
terminal T wave inversions consistent with acute or evolving 
infarction.  Troponin I at OSH was 
___.  He underwent 
cardiac catheterization on the day after discharge, which 
revealed no lesions that would benefit from intervention.  The 
drips were d/ced, and his pain was controlled with rare use of 
PRN morphine, changed to po oxycodone in preparation for 
discharge. His pain was felt to me multifactorial: recent PNA 
___ at OSH, his thoracic aoritc aneurysm, and some 
element of angina. He had no ECG changes during episodes of 
chest pain here.  He was continued on ASA and Plavix, as well as 
statin (Atorva 80), beta blocker (Metoprolol) and RAAS blocker 
(Losartan).  He will follow up with Cardiology after discharge.
.
#. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: EF 35%, 
decompensated upon presentation, much improved at the time of 
discharge. He has a long-standing history of heart failure.  His 
EF is similar to on prior studies but his LV size has reportedly 
increased over the past 6 months.  This is possibly from his 
valvular disorders (mod/severe MR, significant AR). He had 
diffuse rales and focal crackles at right lung base on admission 
with report of CT evidence of effusions at OSH.  CXR here upon 
transfer showed pulmonary edema.  He was diuresed with Lasix IV, 
and then was transitioned to po Lasix and Spironolactone.  He 
was continued on beta blocker and RAAS blocker.
.
#. Hypoxia: multifactorial (chronic OSA, acute CHF, and recent 
pneumonia.)
Has suppplemental O2 at home in addition to his CPAP which he 
uses intermittently for unclear reasons. Per his current PCP, 
the patient has never been hypoxic or dyspnic in the office. He 
had PFTs in ___ which were suggestive of restrictive lung 
disease, although he carries no formal Pulmonary diagnosis. He 
was seen by the ___ consult service and PFTs were ordered and 
were unremarkable. His O2 requirement was weaned down ultimately 
to room air as he diuresed. The patient was saturating low-mid 
___ on RA on the day of discharge. He will follow up with 
pulmonology as an outpatient.    
.
#. s/p AFib, with increased ectopy: concerning for arrhythmia 
from ischemia.  
He was monitored on telemetry and he was beta blocked to goal HR 
60.  Due to recent Afib at OSH, he was put on a Heparin gtt, but 
after discussion with the patient, his wife, and the primary 
cardiologist via email, it was decided not to start the patient 
on coumadin, so heparin was d/ced.
.
#. Hypertension: He was continued on Metoprolol, and as he 
stabilized some of his other home antihypertensives were added 
back (losartan, isosorbide mononitrate, and spironolactone). 
Home medications Hydralazine and HCTZ were not resumed as BP was 
in the ___ once his sCHF and CAD were optimally 
medically managed.  
.
#. Renal Insufficiency: Acute on Chronic 
His baseline Creatinine is 1.5, probably due to HTN.  Upon 
presentation he was near baseline but increased to a peak value 
of 1.9, likely due to prerenal state from poor forward flow from 
CHF in addition to diuresis.  At the time of discharge, his 
creatinine was back to his baseline at 1.5.
.
#. Urinary retention: Pt started on Cipro for possible UTI given 
bloody UA and an episode of chills, although pt was afebrile 
throughout his admission. UCx grew < 10,000 colonies, so abx 
were d/ced. A second urine culture is pending at the time of 
discharge. Pt has a history of prostate CA with reported mild 
urinary Sx (slight hesitency in urine stream). He failed a 
voiding trial this admission, so foley was re-placed. Will d/c 
to rehab with foley in place and have arranged for pt to follow 
up with his urologist. Most recent PSA had been 6.3 in ___, repeat PSA was ordered at the request of his oncologist. 
It was 45.9; this informaton was communicated to his oncologist 
who states that PSA in the setting of a foley in place can be 
unreliable. He will arrange for a CT and bone scan before Mr. 
___ oncology appointment ___.    
.
# Internal hemorrhoids: Noted on rectal exam given complaints of 
discomfort. Pt's bowel reg was increased and hemorrhoid 
suppositories ordered. Per patient, has had hemorrhoids in the 
past, but not in a few years. Pt's discomfort is much improved 
after this interventions.    
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,
.
Thank you for coming to ___ for 
your care.  You were transferred to ___ because of chest 
discomfort, EKG changes, and blood work that were concerning for 
a heart attack.  Though you probably did have a recent heart 
attack, when you underwent cardiac catheterization and there 
were no arteries that needed to be opened at this time.  
.
In addition, you were found to have low oxygen levels in your 
blood, which was probably due to a combination of congestive 
heart failure and needing to recover from your recent pneumonia. 
We gave you breathing treatments, got rid of the extra fluid, 
and we were eventually able to wean you off of oxygen. We had 
our Pulmonary doctors ___, and you had pulmonary 
function tests that were unremarkable. We would like you to see 
your pulmonologist, Dr. ___ you leave the hospital.
.
While you were at the other hospital, they noted that you went 
into an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrilation. We 
discussed that this has an increased risk of stroke and the 
risks and benefits of starting warfarin or coumadin, which we 
decided not to do. 
.
You will be going to rehab with a foley catheder in place. You 
had difficulty urinating when we tried to remove the catheder. 
We would like you to see your oncologist and your Urologist when 
you leave the hospital. 
.
Please weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up 
more than 3 lbs.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
- Please STOP taking hydralazine
- Please STOP taking HCTZ
- Please STOP taking KCl for now. They will keep an eye on your 
potassium at rehab. 
- Please DECREASE your Lasix to 40mg daily. This dose may be 
adjusted while you are at Rehab. 
- Please DECREASE your losartan to 25mg daily
- Please DECREASE you metoprolol succinate to 25mg daily
- Please INCREASE your aspirin to 325mg daily
- You make take Tylenol as needed for pain. You may take 
oxycodone 5mg every 6 hours as needed for pain not relieved by 
Tylenol.
- You may use suppositories as needed for hemorroidal pain. You 
should use senna and docusate daily to keep your stools soft. 
.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old gentleman with a history of afib, dCHF and bilateral 
pleural effusions s/p tap 1 week prior who presents for fevers 
to 101.7 from ___.  
.  
The patient as a recent history of worsening peripheral edema 
and dyspnea since ___ associated w/ intermittant fevers. 
During an admission to ___ in ___ he was treated for CHF w/ 
IV lasix and aldacone and for a PNA w/ azithromycin and 
ceftriaxone. His d/c dose of lasix was 40mg PO bid. In the 
setting of persistent shortness of breath despite diuresis, a 
chest CT scan was performed on ___ at ___ which 
demonstrated significant right pleural effusion and smaller left 
sided effusion. Three days later, ___ guided thoracentesis 
drained 1.5L of fluid w/ significant improvement in his 
breathing post tap before his shortness of breath returned. A 
repeat CT scan on ___ was performed to evaluate his lung 
parenchyma post thoracentesis, and re-accumulation of his right 
sided effusion was noted and no other acute processes. At this 
time the patient was referred to pulmonary at ___ for further 
work-up. Dr. ___ that in the setting of 
diastolic dysfunction with intermittent hypokinesis heart 
failure could be the driving cause behind the development of 
pleural fluid. He suggested consideration of a cardiac 
catheterization to evaluate the patients coronaries in addition 
to work-up of nephrotic syndrome given the patients low serum 
protein.  
.  
With regards to his prior cardiac work-up. A TTE from ___ 
at ___ demonstrates hypokinesis of the basal to mid lateral 
and inferolateral walls with mild-to-moderate mitral and 
mild-to-moderate aortic regurgination. The LVEF was 60-65% and 
right and left atrial enlargement were noted. A repeat TTE on 
___ demonstrated improved wall motion abnormaliteis with 
less AR and MR and TR gradient of 37 and LVEF again 60-65%.  
.  
The patient presented to ___ w/ fever at home to 101.7. He his 
breathing had improved during the past week on increased lasix 
and spironolactone therapy. This AM, he awoke fatiged and 
developed chills in the ___. He stopped into a hot bath and could 
not get out. His wife took his temperature and transferred him 
to ___. He denies recent cough, fevers, chills, nausea, emesis, 
diarrhea, constipation. Inital vitals were : 135/65 71 18 98% on 
2L NC. In addition he was reportably febrile. Labs were 
signiicant for a troponin T of 0.28 (last 0.155) and creatinine 
1.8 (baseline 1.2-1.4), a CPK 122 and CK-MB of 4.20. He was 
given 1gm ctx, lasix 40mg IV, and aspirin 325mg at 2:30 AM. He 
was not started on heparin given he was on warfarin. A chest 
xray was performed which showed no obvious signs of pneumona, 
evidence of the right sided pleural effusion. He was transferred 
to ___ for further management.  
.  
At ___, initial vitals were 98.2 72 113/49 18 99% 4L NC. AN 
EKG demonstrated afib 77 w/ RBBB, NA/NI, c/w prior early today; 
RBBB is new since ___. The patient was transferred immediately 
to the cardiology floor for futher management.  
.  
Currently, vitals are 98.9 118/62 70 20 96RA. He is comfortable 
breahting at baseline complaining of gerd sx which are chronic 
___ barretts. He reports his breathing and lower extremity edema 
are at baseline.

Microbiology:
blood cultures (___) x2 no growth
urine cultures ___ and ___ no growth

Imaging:
TTE ___:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly 
depressed (LVEF= 40 %) with hypokinesis of the basal and mid 
segments and a relative preservation of the distal segments and 
apex. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right 
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal with depressed free wall contractility. 
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild 
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet 
is eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, 
posteriorly directed jet of mild to moderate (___) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargment. Normal left ventricular cavity 
size with moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and 
impaired regional left ventricular systolic function as 
described above. Increased left ventricular filling pressure. 
Right ventricular hypertrophy with depressed right ventricular 
systolic function. Mildly dilated aortic root and ascending 
aorta. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
The above findings could be consistent with an infiltrative 
process such as amyloid or, less likely, possible multivessel 
coronary artery disease; clinical correlation is suggested. 
Compared to the previous study of ___ (images unavailable 
for review), the biventricular systolic function is worse and 
the left ventricular wall motion abnormalities are new. The 
severity of mitral regurgitation has increased from mild to 
mild-to-moderate. The severity of pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension has increased from mild to moderate.

CXR ___:
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. The azygos vein is 
distended as before. Right pleural effusion, that is moderate, 
has reaccumulated. There is no pneumothorax. Right lower lobe 
atelectasis has worsened. Right middle lobe atelectasis has also 
increased. There is mild vascular congestion. 

CXR ___:
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Large right pleural effusion 
has increased associated with adjacent atelectasis. There is no 
pneumothorax. There is mild vascular congestion. 

CXR ___:  
Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion ahs increased with 
increasing adjacent atelectasis. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
Small left pleural effusion has increased. Mild vascular 
congestion has increased. There is no pneumothorax. 

Abdominal ultrasound ___:
1. Echogenic liver, likely denoting steatosis. More advanced 
disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be excluded with 
this technique. 
2. Slight increase in size of right upper pole and left mid pole 
renal cysts. 
3. Large right pleural effusion. 

Cardiac MRI ___: 
1. Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with severely 
increased mass index and normal left ventricular cavity size. 
The LVEF was mildly decreased at 47% secondary to basal to mid 
inferior and lateral wall hypokinesis. The effective forward 
LVEF was mildly decreased at 45%. There was CMR evidence of 
focal patchy transmural gadolinium hyperenhancement in the basal 
to mid lateral wall. Although this pattern is atypical for 
amyloid, it has been previously described in rare cases of 
biopsy proven cardiac amyloidosis and, in association with the 
other findings described below, is suggestive of this 
infiltrative process. Based on the non-coronary distribution of 
the wall motion abnormalities and gadolinium hyperenhacement, 
healed myocarditis should also be considered in the differential 
diagnosis.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size with moderately 
decreased global systolic function. The RVEF was normal at 35%. 
3. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending 
thoracic aorta were normal. The indexed diameter of the main 
pulmonary artery was mildly increased.
4. Mitral and aortic regurgitation (not quantified).
5. Moderate biatrial enlargement.
6. Trace pericardial and very large right pleural effusion.

CXR ___: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of ___, there has 
been placement of a right pigtail catheter with some decrease in 
the amount of pleural effusion.  Otherwise, little change except 
for some improvement in pulmonary vascular status. No evidence 
of pneumothorax. 

Carotid Doppler ___: 
Impression: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA <40% stenosis. 

Skeletal Surgery ___:
IMPRESSION: No definite lytic lesions. Note MRI is more 
sensitive to 
evaluate for myelomatous lesions. 

Cardiac Catheterization ___: FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Severe ostial 
LMCA with eccentric plaque with IVUS calculated area of 6.3. 2. 
Severely diseased LAD by IVUS (calculated area 2.3). 

Pathology: 

Cardiac Biopsy: ___: Heart, right ventricle, biopsy: 
Amyloidosis, see note. Note:  ___ red is positive, with 
apple-green birefringence.

Bone Marrow Bx: Hypercellular marrow, with ~40% of cellularity 
replaced by sheets and large aggregates of plasma cells.  
Trilineage maturing hematopoietic cells present in background.

Fat pad Bx: Mature fibroadipose tissue without evidence of 
amyloid.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man history of Afib, dCHF, 
persistent bilateral pleural effusions who was transferred from 
outside hospital for workup of his effusions who was found to 
have CAD, decompensated diastolic heart failure and cardiac 
amyloydosis who is currently stable.  

#Coronary Artery Disease:   Patient had NSTEMI on admission with 
elevated troponins (peaked at 0.39) with TWI in V1-V3.  His TTE 
showed global hypokineses and substantially reduced EF compared 
to prior, and evidence of possible infiltration.  He underwent a 
cardiac catheterization on ___ which showed 50% left main 
disease, 50% LAD stenosis, and no intervention was performed at 
this time as evalution for CABG was preferred for the left main 
disease.  Because his cardiac biopsy pathology showed 
amyloydosis a CABG was not appropriate.  Dicussions with 
multiple interventional cardiology attendings discussed whether 
stenting of the left main would be beneficial in this patient. 
It was felt that at this time he would be too high risk to 
undergo PCI of the left main with his possible upcoming 
treatment for his amyloidosis.  This can be further assessed in 
the future with his outpatient cardiologist Dr. ___.  
Therefore he will continue with medical management for his CAD.
-Medical management of his CAD with Aspirin, Metoprolol, 
-Not starting ACE at this time as he has elevated Cr
-Starting Atorvastatin 80mg po qday

# dCHF: The patient had known diastolic heart failure and was 
volume overload on his admission.  TTE on ___ showed  Biatrial 
enlargment, right and left ventricular hypertophy and decrease 
RV systolic function and global hypokinesis concerning for 
infiltrative process.  He underwent a fat pad biopsy and right 
ventricle cardiac biopsy which showed amyloidosis.  He was 
volume overload on exam with 2+pitting edema to the thighs on 
admission.His weight on admission was 110kg.  He was   He was 
diuresed with IV lasix boluses and his weight at discharge was 
99.6 kg.  His goal dry weight was 95kg.
-He will require continued diuresis as an oupatient with goal 
weight of 95kg
-Patient will need to be weighed daily, and if weight increases 
by 3lbs should have medications adjusted
-Continue po lasix  with IV doses if required to help diurese 
patient
.
#Cardiac Amyloid and Multiple Myeloma:  Patient underwent a 
workup for infiltrative disease and was found to have a 
monoclonal kappa band and severe hypogammaglobulinemia on 
SPEP/UPEP.  He underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed 40% 
plasma cells. Cardiac MRI performed, was not conclusive for 
infiltrative disease.  Abdominal fat pad biopsy both performed 
___, revealed no amyloid. Started on dexamthasone. RV cardiac 
biopsy was positive for amyloid.  Further treatment discussions 
will be deffered to the outpatient oncologist.
-Patient completed 4 days of dexamethasone and this was 
discontinued at discharge for concern of contributing to volume 
overload. Pt will continue allopurinol ___ po qday
-patient to follow-up with Dr. ___ on ___
.
#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient has Chronic Afib with CHADS2 = 2 
(age and CHF).  On coumadin as outpatient with supratherapeutic 
INR on presentation (3.3).  His warfarin was held towards the 
end of his hospitalization for possible interventions so he was 
subtherapeutic at the time of discharge. He was rate controlled 
during this admission.
-Restart his warfarin at home dose of 5mg po qday, no need for 
bridging given his low CHADS2 score.
-Monitor INR every other day with goal INR of 2.0-2.5 given for 
increased risk of bleeding with amyloid
-Patient was switched from atenolol to metoprolol given his 
worsening renal function
.
# ___:  Cr 1.8 on presentation, this is elevated compared to his 
baseline of 1.2-1.4. This was stable throughout his admission 
while being diuresed.
-Continue to monitor
-___ require further outpatient workup if remains elevated
- Will call patient to establish renal f/u
.
# PLEURAL EFFUSION:  Patient has persistent pleural effusions. 
Transudate based on lights criteria.
-Will follow-up with pulmonology
.
# LFTs:  ALP noted to be elevated at OSH, ALT/AST and T bili 
normal.  Patient is s/p cholecystectomy.  Repeat LFTs also 
showed elevated SLP and LDH.  Possibly due to infiltrative 
process.
.
# Macrocytic anemia:  Anemia is within his prior normal range, 
but MCV now elevated to low 100s, and RDW slightly elevated.  
B12 and folate normal, iron studies show elevated TRF, otherwise 
normal.  Retic count normal.
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.
You came to the hospital with shortness of breath and fever. You 
were found to have a heart attack and underwent a cardiac 
catheterization which found some blockages in your arteries 
called coronary artery disease.  Because of the amyloid in your 
heart having heart surgery was determined to not be apporpirate 
for you.  You will manage the blockages in your heart arteries 
with medications at this time and can discuss further 
interventions with Dr. ___ as an outpatient. 
You underwent a cardiac biopsy without complication and were 
found to have multiple myeloma with amyloid in your heart. You 
were seen by the hematology/oncologists and they will discuss 
your treatment options as an outpatient when you follow-up with 
them (see below).
You had extra fluid on your body due to your heart backing up 
called (congestive heart failure). We were taking fluid off by 
give you medications called diuretics (lasix and 
spironolactone). You still have extra fluid on at the time of 
discharge, and will need to have this followed at rehab.
 You were found to have fluid at the base of your lungs (pleural 
effusion), which you have had previously.  You also had excess 
fluid throughout your body.  You were treated with diuretics to 
reduce the fluid overload.  The Pulmonary team again drained 
fluid from your lungs.  Your breathing slowly improved with 
these treatments.  You should follow-up with Pulmonary to 
discuss ways to keep this fluid from returning.

We made multiple changes to you medications while you were here.

History of Present Illness:
___ yo male with PMH significant for asthma, schizophrenia, 
psoriatic arthritis, h/o DVT, COPD, HTN who presented to the ED 
with shorntess of breath, tachycardia.  He was severely dypsneic 
with heart rates of 130s, found to be new atrial flutter.  He 
had CXR with left greater than right small pleural effusions, 
pulmonary edema, concern for possible pneumonia.  He was 
initially started on Cefepime/Vancomycin for HCAP, steroids for 
possible COPD exacerbation component.  He was then de-escalated 
to Ceftriaxone for ongoing treatment of pneumonia (day 1 of 
treatment ___. Other infectious work up was negative.  

For rate control, he had required increaisng doses of CCBs and 
beta blockers in the FICU, and was on a dilt gtt for rates 
persisting in the 140s.  He was seen in consultation by EP team 
on ___.  A long discussion was had with patient's legal 
guardian regarding options for restoring sinus rhythm and 
improving patient's symptoms.  Patient had TTE on ___ 
showing dilated left atrium, EF of 60%, normal RV chamber size 
and free wall motion.  Patient was subsequently diuresed and 
today went for TEE to rule out ___ which showed no 
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in ___.  Patient 
then underwent EP ablation for his atrial flutter which was 
noted to be typical counterclockwise Aflutter.  There were no 
inducible arrhythmias at the end of the procedure.  

Patient was then transferred to the cardiology EP service for 
ongoing care.  Post procedure on the floor, he reported no pain.

IMAGING:
___ CXR  
Left greater than right small pleural effusions.  Pulmonary 
edema.  Mild 
cardiomegaly.  Underlying infection difficult to exclude in the 
appropriate clinical setting. 

___ CXR
Increasing moderate pulmonary edema with accompanying pleural 
effusions right greater than left. 

___ pCXR: 
In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac 
silhouette is within
normal limits.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with 
chronic
pulmonary disease.  There is again prominence of interstitial 
markings, some
of which represents elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, 
while there may be
some component of chronic interstitial lung disease.  Poor 
definition of the
hemidiaphragms is consistent with small pleural effusions an 
basilar
atelectasis bilaterally. There is an area of increased 
opacification in the left upper zone, also seen previously, that 
could represent a focus of consolidation.  The area of
possible increased opacification the upper zone on the right is 
not definitely
seen on the current study, though it could be hidden be hind the 
first rib.

___ ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild ___. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. IVC dilated 
(>2.1cm) with <50% decrease with sniff (estimated RA pressure 
(>=15 mmHg). 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. 
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). 
Beat-to-beat variability on LVEF due to irregular 
rhythm/premature beats. No resting LVOT gradient. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal 
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. 
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch 
diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch. 

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. 
No AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild 
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve 
chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS. ___ (1+) 
MR. 

___ VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Normal 
tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Moderate [2+] TR. 
Normal PA systolic pressure. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. 
No PS. Physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for 
PDA 

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space 
which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated 
anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. 
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to 
position.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF = 60%). There is considerable 
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection 
fraction due to an irregular rhythm. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal 
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad. 
 
___ ECHO: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen 
in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body 
of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. The right atrial 
appendage ejection velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricle 
is not well seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. 

IMPRESSION: No SEC or thrombus in the ___. Moderate 
mitral regurgitation.

EKG ___:

Sinus rhythm. Left atrial enlargement. Low limb lead voltage. 
Prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous 
tracing
of ___ the rate has increased. There is variation in 
precordial
lead placement. The previously recorded early precordial R wave 
transition is
no longer in evidence. There are now Q waves in leads V1-V2 
consistent with
interim anteroseptal infarction. The limb lead voltage has 
diminished.
The rate has increased and there are ST-T wave changes. Followup 
and clinical
correlation are suggested.

Cardiac Catheterization ___:

1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed
3 vessel disease with an acute proximal LAD lesion.  The LMCA 
had no
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease.  The LAD had an 
acute
lesion of 99% stenosis in the proximal segment.  The first 
diagonal had
80% stenosis.  The LCX had 40% hazy stenosis at the mid segment. 
 The
RCA was chronically totally occluded at the proximal segment and 
was
filled by left to right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated right 
sided
filling pressures (RVEDP 26 mm Hg) and markedly elevated left 
sided
filling pressures (PCWP 25 mm Hg).  There was mild PA 
hypertension (PA
40/27 mm Hg).

3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
 PTCA of  vessel.

Transthoracic Echo ___:

The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is 
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
moderate to severe hypokinesis of the septum. The anterior wall 
may be hypokinetic also. The inferolateral wall may be slightly 
hypokinetic but suboptimal image quality limits certainty. The 
right ventricular cavity is dilated. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets 
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat 
pad.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with moderate to severe septal 
hypokinesis. The anterior wall is probably hypokinetic but is 
not well seen. The RV is dilated and probably hypokinetic but 
image quality limits interpretation. No significant valvular 
abnormality seen. Large anterior fat pad. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:

blood pressure stabilized and his dopamine was discontinued on 
___.  His balloon pump was removed ___.  ___ was extubated on 
___. ___ was started on carvedilol and lisinopril, which were 
initially held given his hypotension. His carvedilol was 
switched to metoprolol and ___ was found to have better rate 
control with metoprolol. His enzymes were trended and found to 
peak at CK 2742, troponin 5.15.  Given his septal and anterior 
wall hypokinesis, the patient was bridged with enoxaparin and 
started on coumadin. ___ was started on 5mg coumadin daily from

History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with a history of hypertension, 
hyperlidipemia, diabetes, smoking history and no known CAD who 
presented to the ED complaining of chest pressure. Patient 
reports that about six months ago started experinced substernal 
chest pressure with radiation to the neck, jaw and back on 
excertion after walking for 2 blocks which would resolve after 
resting for few seconds. In the interim she was seen by her PCP 
who recommended ___ stress test which patient refused.  Yesterday 
patient reports as she was walking outside she starting getting 
similar chest pain that were happening more frequently with less 
amount of exertion and she had to rest frequently to relieve her 
symptoms.  Then this morning at 7:30 am she was in her bed when 
she developed ___ dull ache in the chest associated with 
worsening SOB, nausea and diaphoresis.  She took aspirina and 
tylenol which did not relive her symptoms.  She continued to 
have constant pain and SOB until 12:30pm when her daugther 
insisteted that she co to the ED and called EMS. EMS arrived 
today and administered aspirin and one nitroglycerin and her 
symptoms almost completely resolved. She has not had any recent 
surgeries travel immobilization, no history of thromboembolic 
disease in self or family.
.
Initial vitals in ED triage were T 97.2, HR 114, BP 127/70, RR 
22, and SpO2 90% on RA.  Initial Troponin was 0.03 with CK 101 
and CKMB 5.  Labs were notable for WBC 13.0 (N 87.8%), Hct 36.4 
(unclear baseline), Plt 269, Cr 1.1 (at baseline), unremarkable 
electrolytes, and normal coags. EKG showed sinus tachycardia 
with inferolateral 
.
Code STEMI was called.  She was given Nitroglycerin SL, Morphine 
5 mg IV, Metoprolol 5 mg IV, and started on a Heparin drip.  She 
was taken directly to the cath lab.  Vitals prior to cath lab 
transfer were HR 125, BP 156/84, RR 24, and SpO2 96% on RA.  She 
was found to have a proximal LCx 99% lesion with thrombus which 
was treated with Export aspiration thrombectomy followed by PTCA 
and stenting with a Promus DES.  Her RFA access site was closed 
with a ___ ExoSeal device.   She was admitted to the CCU for 
post-cath monitoring.  
.
On reaching the CCU, she reports feeling well without any chest 
pain or shortness of breath.  She dnies any hsitory of 
orthiopnea, PND or peripheral edema, syncope, lightheadedness.

Cardiac Echo:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. There is an inferobasal left ventricular 
aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely 
depressed (LVEF = 25 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis 
of the inferior septum, inferior free wall, posterior wall, and 
lateral wall. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is 
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion.

Impression: inferoposterolateral myocardial infarct; severe left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction; inferobasal aneurysm  

Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system 
demonstrated 
two-vessel disease. The ___ had no significant stenosis. The 
LAD had a 
diffuse 70% stenosis in the mid portion. The LCx had a 99% 
thrombus in 
the proximal portion. There was a small OM2 with diffuse disease 
and 
high OM1 free of significant disease. The RCA was small and 
non-dominant 
with an anterior take-off. 
2. Inferolateral STEMI 
3. Successful aspiration thrombectomy and PCI of the proximal 
LCx with 
3.0x18mm drug-eluting stent post-dilated to 3.5mm (see ___ 
comments). 
4. Successful right femoral arteriotomy closure with ___ ExoSeal 
device. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with a history of hypertension, 
hyperlidpiemia, diabetes, smoking history and no prior known CAD 
who presented found to be having a inferolateral STEMI with 
thrombotic lesion in the proximal LCx treated successfully with 
aspiration thrombectomy and DES.

Active Issues addressed on this hospitalization:
# Inferolateral STEMI: Patient with multiple cardiovascualr risk 
factors (obeseity, HTN, HLD, smoking history)and 6 months of 
exertional chest pain presented LCx STEMI. She had successful 
PCI to the LCx with placement of a DES. She did well 
post-procedure. She was started on ASA 81mg, Plavix, Metoporol, 
and atrovastatin and her home lisinopril was continued. She had 
a follow up echo (report included in this D/C summary) that 
showed significant wall motion abnormalitis with a moderatly 
depressed ejection fraction. She will follow up with Dr. ___ as 
an outpatient for follow up cardiac echo and for nuclear stress 
test for her CAD as discussed below. 

# CAD: The patient had a stent to the LCx but was also found to 
have that her LAD had a diffuse 70% stenosis in the mid portion. 
There was a small OM2 with diffuse disease and high OM1 free of 
significant disease. The RCA was small and non-dominant 
with an anterior take-off. She has proper medical managment for 
this level of disease at this time. It was also stressed to her 
that she needed to keep her diabetes under better contol and she 
should exercise more often. She will need outpatient MIBI for 
evaluation of this lesion. 

Chronic Issues:
# HTN: Her blood pressures following the PCI were well 
controlled on Metoprolol and Lisinopril. Her HCTZ was held given 
her SBP in the 110s-120s.

#DM: She was placed on a insulin sliding scale while 
hospitalized as she recieved contrast for her PCI. She was 
instructed to restart her home medications at time of discharge. 


Transitional Issues:
# LAD had a diffuse 70% stenosis in the mid portion. She will 
need outpatient MIBI for evaluation of this lesion. This will be 
scheduled with Dr. ___. 

# HTN: Her HCTZ was stopped on this admission in favor of 
starting a beta-blocker in the ___ time. Her blood pressure 
was well controlled with SBP in the 110s-120s and so she was 
instructed to not restart the HCTZ until instructed to do so by 
her PCP. 

# DM: At time of discharge the patient had a A1c pending. The 
patietn last had her A1c checked in ___ and was elevated at 
that time.

Blood cx (___): NGTD x2

CXR (___): Single portable AP upright view of the chest was 
obtained. There is blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles, 
raising concern for small bilateral pleural effusions. 
Indistinct central vasculature suggests central pulmonary 
vascular congestion/edema. More confluent area of opacity 
projecting over he left mid lung is seen, which could relate to 
fluid overload, although an infectious process/pneumonia cannot 
be excluded. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac 
silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. 

CXR (___): Aeration of the lower lobes has improved. Right upper 
lobe and left mid lung opacities are unchanged; this is more 
likely due to infectious process. There is no overt CHF. There 
is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.  Mild 
cardiomegaly is stable. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Her presenting dyspnea and hypoxia was most likely due to severe 
healthcare-associated pneumonia. She was treated with 
vancomycin/cefepime and later added metronidazole. There was an 
apparent component of pulmonary edema, which resolved with 
furosemide diuresis, although she subsequently developed acute 
renal failure. Prednisone was initially started for possible 
COPD exacerbation. As this seemed clinically unlikely, steroids 
were stopped, although nebulizer treatments were continued for 
wheezing. ACS was ruled out with EKG/trop. She remained hypoxic 
and oxygen dependent, in apparent respiratory distress with 
tachypnea. Due to lack of improvement with above treatments, and 
worsening somnolence, the decision was made with her family 
(son/HCP and daughter-in-law) to focus on comfort measures only. 
All medications not related to comfort, including antibiotics, 
were stopped and morphine concentrated solution was used for 
pain. She is being transferred back to ___, where her 
family feels she will be more comfortable.

Ill-defined opacities in bilateral lung bases could represent 
aspiration or pneumonia. 

___ CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O

IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions. 
2. Cholelithiasis without gallbladder distention or gallbladder 
wall edema. 
3. 7 mm nodule in left lobe of the thyroid.  Given the size of 
this nodule, no 
additional imaging follow-up is recommended. 
4. Bowel is unremarkable without evidence of obstruction.  The 
appendix is 
normal. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ ___ male h/o HTN, HLD, DM2, CAD s/p 
NSTEMI, CKD3 who presents from SNF with acute onset of 
respiratory distress and altered mental status.

===================
ACTIVE ISSUES
=================== 

# Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
# Possible aspiration:
Patient presents with acute onset respiratory distress.  Chest 
x-ray showed ill-defined opacities with subsequent CT chest 
demonstrating pleural effusions but no clear infiltrate.  The 
patient was initially admitted to the intensive care unit and 
started on vancomycin and Zosyn, subsequently narrowed to 
levofloxacin.  He initially required BiPAP for respiratory 
support.  Patient improved rapidly on BiPAP, remained afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  His white blood count remained 
within normal limits.  In this setting, antibiotics were 
subsequently stopped given low suspicion for bacterial 
pneumonia. Infectious work up remained negative. This 
presentation was likely multifactorial with possible 
contribution of an aspiration event in the setting of his 
underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and possible 
recurrent flash pulmonary edema.  Speech and swallow was 
consulted and found no overt signs of aspiration.  The patient's 
diet was subsequently advanced with good tolerance. Monitoring 
for possible aspiration following discharge is recommended. 

#Possible Acute on chronic heart failure
#HFrEF (most recent EF 40% in ___ at outside hospital for)
#H/o CAD with prior NSTEMI and s/p CABG
During recent hospital stay at ___ developed 
hypertensive urgency complicated by flash pulmonary edema in the 
setting of underlying heart failure. Concern for recurrent 
episode of flash pulmonary edema this admission given severe 
shortness of breath on admission which rapidly improved on 
BiPAP. His respiratory status improved rapidly as above. He 
received IV diuresis, which was complicated by worsening renal 
function as below. Diuresis was subsequently stopped with 
stabilization of his volume status and renal function. His home 
metoprolol was continued. Amlodipine was stopped given his 
history of HFrEF. Give renal dysfunction, no ACE inhibitor was 
started. Instead, the patient was started in Isurdil/Hydral. He 
tolerated his blood pressure regimen well without recurrent 
episodes of severe hypertension or hypotension. Aspirin was 
continued (albeit at the lower dose of 81mg daily given low 
likelihood that possible benefits of a higher dose would 
outweigh the increased bleeding risk). His home regimen did not 
include a statin. No statin was started given his age and low 
likelihood that any possible benefits would outweigh the side 
effects.  
Discharge weigth: 154.2 lbs 

#COPD
Per ___ medical records, he has a history of COPD.  Appears to 
be only on albuterol as outpatient. COPD was possibly 
contributing to his respiratory dysfunction on admission, but 
was thought to not be severe enough to start systemic steroids 
given concerns about his volume status in the setting of his 
heart failure. The patient was treated with nebulizers and an 
inhaled steroid, as well as supportive treatment with 
guaifenesin and nasal fluticasone. 

___ on CKD stage 3 (per his outside hospital records, baseline 
appears to be around 2)
Cr 1.6 on admission, uptrending to 2.3 during this admission in 
the setting of diuresis as detailed above.  Subsequently 
improved with diuresis and stabilized around 2.0. His home lasix 
was restarted on discharge. 
Discharge Creatinine: 2.0

CHRONIC ISSUES
=================== 
# Choledocholithiasis: Patient has known choledocholithiasis and 
has not had any interventions performed. CT torso showed 
cholelithiasis without gallbladder distention or gallbladder 
wall edema.

# Anemia: Stable at baseline.

CXR ___
FINDINGS: The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular 
configuration. The aortic arch is calcified. Allowing for 
differences in technique, the mediastinal and hilar contours 
appear unchanged. There is probably slight congestion with a 
mild interstitial abnormality including peribronchial cuffing 
although this is probably a background finding for which 
differential considerations include slight chronic pulmonary 
congestion or airway inflammation. Otherwise, the lungs appear 
clear aside from patchy posterior basilar opacity partly 
obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, suggesting minor atelectasis. 
Mild degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine. 
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the chest.
.
TTE ___
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global 
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus 
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is 
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral 
regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Dilated thoracic 
aorta.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar.
.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND  ___ 
FINDINGS: Limited evaluation of the liver that is within normal 
limits. No fluid is seen around the liver. No fluid is seen in 
the right and left lower quadrant.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of ascites.
.
CXR ___
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient 
has received a new pacemaker. The pacemaker leads are in 
expected position. The pacemaker generator is located in the 
left pectoral region. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette 
without pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusions.
.
CXR ___
FINDINGS: A left pectoral dual-chamber pacer terminates in the 
region of the right atrium and ventricle. The heart size is top 
normal. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or focal 
consolidation. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the 
aortic knob. IMPRESSION: Stable placement of dual-chamber pacer. 
No evidence of complication.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with h/o hypertension, type 2 
diabetes, obesity, and venous stasis with recurrent cellulitis 
who presents with shortness of breath and lightheadedness and 
found to have sinus bradycardia with concern for significant 
conduction disease. 
   
# Shortness of breath: Diastolic Heart Failure
The patient presented with new onset exertional dyspnea 
concerning for unstable angina or heart failure. The patient had 
no previous documented history of CAD, but possessed risk 
factors including HTN and DM. Exercise Stress test in ___ in 
setting of a research study revealed fair exercise tolerance w/o 
symptoms, but unable to interpret changes due to LBBB. The 
patient's history, edema, and CXR with note of interstitial 
edema  were highly suggestive of diastolic heart failure. The 
patient was started on IV furosemide with improvement in 
symptoms following diuresis. He was diuresed with Furosemide 
20mg IV daily from ___ and ___ with good response. He was 
then transitioned to oral furosemide at 40mg, on which he was 
discharged. Admission weight was 149.8kg. Discharge weight was 
144.4kg. The patient had a fluid balance of negative five to six 
liters prior to discharge. His renal function remained stable. 
The patient will need to follow up in the outpatient setting to 
re-assess renal function and electrolytes and possibly adjust 
diuretic dose. 

Transthoracic echo during this admission showed LVH, EF>60% , 
and mild mitral regurgitation. No discrete wall motion 
abnormalities were noted, (although due to suboptimal study this 
was not excluded.) The patient was continued on cardioprotective 
regimen of Aspirin 81mg daily and lisinopril 30mg daily. A 
statin was not initiated in the inpatient setting, but the 
patient may benefit from a statin for endothelial protective 
aspects. A beta blocker was not initiated given concern for 
heart block.  The patient will follow up in the outpatient 
setting with his PCP and with cardiology for further management.
.
.  
# Arrythmia:  
On admission the patient was in sinus rhythm, but bradycardic 
with first degree AVB. EKG and telemetry in ED showed evidence 
of 2:1 conduction. With carotid sinus massage bradycardia was 
able to bring out wenchebach AV block. With abulation patient 
had increased heart rate with 1:1 conduction, however, also 
noted  widened QRS/LBBB. This suggested AVN disease and rate 
related LBBB or pause related LBBB. Altogether, this was 
concerning for potentially significant infranodal conduction 
system disease and potential for further decompensation in 
future to third degree heart block. Patient underwent EP study 
on ___ which showed disease in his-bundle system with high risk 
for heart block so a dual chamber pacemaker was placed. The 
patient suffered no complications. He was discharged on a short 
course of prophylactic antibiotics and will follow up in device 
clinic as an outpatient. Of note, the patient uses multiple 
complementary/alternative medicine devices containing magnets 
for the treatment of Diabetic neuropathy. He was informed of the 
dangers of placing a magnet directly over the chest in the area 
of the pacemaker. He was instructed to bring these devices to 
clinic for further assessment.
.  
.  
#  HYPERTENSION
Remained adequately controlled for the majority of his hospital 
course. He was continued on Lisinopril 30 mg daily and started 
on Furosemide 40 mg daily. 
.
#  DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2
Patient's A1C was 7.5 in ___. Patient's insulin requirement 
was reduced in the inpatient setting likely reflecting improved 
adherence to diabetic diet. Patient appeared to have poor 
understanding of low simple carb diet and described a distaste 
for artificial sweeteners. Nutrition consult was obtained for 
education regarding diabetic and cardiac diet.  He was 
discharged on his home insulin regimen with instructions to 
monitor blood glucose closely and call MD for BG less than 80 or 
more than 250 for proper insulin titration. 
.  
#  HYPERLIPIDEMIA
LDL on  ___ was 103. ___ 209. TC 175. Patient was not on 
lipid lowering medication upon admission and this was not 
initiated in the inpatient setting. This should be re-addressed 
in the outpatient setting. 
.  
# TINEA CRURIS
Likely related to poorly controlled DM, increased moisture in 
area and obesity. Started on course of Miconazole Powder 2% 1 
Appl TP BID. 
.
# THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND MACROCYTOSIS
Chronic, not far from baseline but etiology unclear. Patient 
denied h/o ETOH abuse, and TSH, B-12, folate were all within 
normal limits. B-12 was noted to be downtrending when comparing 
previous values, thus could consider MMA for confirmation in 
outpatient setting. Values remained stable/ within baseline 
throughout hospital course. 
.
# OSA
He was continued on nocturnal C-PAP.
.
# Weight gain with subjective increase in abdominal girth
Given imprecise exam with patient's body habitus difficult to 
assess.  Laboratory studies revealed normal albumin and no 
significant proteinuria to suggest nephrotic syndrome. Abdominal 
ultrasound was obtained which revealed no underlying ascites.   
Patient feels some improvement with diuresis. Overall, felt 
likely secondary to generalized fluid retention in the setting 
of diastolic heart failure. Patient noted some improvement with 
diuresis. (see above)
.
# Conjunctival erythema and tearing
Patient complained of eye tearing and redness without pruritus 
or purulent dishcarge. Exam without findings concerning for 
infectious conjunctivitis and symptoms felt likely secondary to 
non-specific irriation due to dryness. Patient given artificial 
Tears to be used as needed.
.  
TRANSITION OF CARE
- follow up with PCP for management of DM, HTN, evaluation of 
thrombocytopenia/ macrocytosis, tinea cruris. He will also need 
f/u labs given initiation of diuretic.
- follow up with cardiology for management of diastolic heart 
failure
- follow up with electrophysiology in device clinic
- maintained full code status throughout hospital course.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for low heart rate and 
shortness of breath.  We were concerned that you had a problem 
with the conduction system in your heart that might cause 
abnormal heart rhythms or cause your heart to stop beating. We 
did a procedure to test for this and found significant disease 
in your conduction system that made us worried about the 
possibility of your heart stopping suddenly, so a pacemaker was 
placed. You will need to follow up in device clinic to have this 
checked. Please remember to bring with you all products 
containing magnets so they can be assessed; and please remember 
never to place a magnet over your chest in the area of the 
pacemaker, as this can cause the device to stop working.

You were also found to have some fluid overload. This is because 
your heart muscles are very stiff and are causing blood to back 
up in the lungs and in your legs (diastolic heart failure). We 
treated you with a diurectic, Furosemide (Lasix), and you 
improved. It is important to continue taking this medication to 
prevent fluid from building up. You will need to follow up with 
your doctor once you leave to check labs and to adjust your 
dose. You will also need to see a cardiologist for further 
evaluation of heart failure. It is also important to lose weight 
and control your blood pressure and diabetes, as all of these 
affect your heart.

While you were here you required less insulin than you were on 
before. This is probably because your diet in the hospital had 
less sugar. Please continue to check your blood sugars 
frequently once you leave and call your doctor if your blood 
sugar is less than 80 or more than 250 so that appropriate 
adjustments to your insulin can be made.

Medication changes
START Furosemide (diuretic)
START Miconazole Powder 2% (for skin fungal infection)
START Cephalexin (antibiotic to prevent infection in pacemaker)

associated tumor thrombus) on nivolumab (C3D1 on ___, 
cirrhosis (likely NASH), CAD s/p CABG, AFib on apixiban, DM2 and 
other issues who was admitted with 3 days of progressive cough, 
dyspnea and weakness; treated for PNA/COPD/CHF exacerbation, 
with course complicated by ___, anasarca, and urinary 
retention.

# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure:
# Multifocal pneumonia:
# HFpEF, acute on chronic:
# Mild aortic stenosis:
# Possible COPD:
Patient presented with cough and hypoxia, likely multifactorial 
in etiology from CHF exacerbation (given elevated BNP and lower 
extremity edema, although did not carry a diagnosis previously), 
COPD (given wheezing and radiographic evidence, although does 
not carry a diagnosis), and multifocal PNA seen on CT chest 
(possibly aspiration given inconsistent evidence of overt 
aspiration of SLP evaluation). TTE showed nl EF and mild AS, 
which could also be contributing. No evidence of nivolumab 
pneumonitis or PE on CT chest. He was treated with a 5d course 
of prednisone (through ___ and nebulizer treatments, IV 
Lasix, and antibiotics (cefepime ___ transitioned to 
Unasyn through ___, Vancomycin ___, and Levofloxacin 
___. Hypoxia resolved, and no significant pulmonary edema 
on most recent CXR, but gross volume overload (as manifested 
primarily by lower extremity and scrotal edema) persists.  This 
was thought to be multifactorial in the setting of portal 
hypertension (cirrhosis/portal vein tumor thrombosis), 
hypoalbuminemia, and resolving oliguric ATN.  He was diuresed 
with IV furosemide and occasionally required IV albumin to 
mobilize peripheral edema; he was diruesed down to 172 lbs; 
which was BELOW his approximate pre-admission dry weight range 
of 176-179.  Though he still had lower extremity edema at 
discharge, given his oliguric ATN (peak Cr 3.7), decision was 
made to continue diuresis slowly/gently in the outpatient 
setting rather than continue with inpatient IV diuresis, and he 
was transitioned to Furosemide 80 mg PO.  On a dose of once 
daily, he was was slightly net negative (<0.5L per day), and 
given that he still had a moderate amount of lower extremity 
edema and tolerated this dose well, he was discharged on 
Furosemide 80 mg PO BID, to be titrated by his PCP or 
cardiologist. 

# Venous stasis dermatitis
The patient had mild bilateral lower extremity edema consistent 
with acute venous stasis dermatitis.  He was prescribed a 2- 
week course of topical Fluocinolide cream 0.05% to the bilateral 
legs at discharge.  He MUST wear continuous compression 
stockings during the day until he edema resolves, and please 
keep legs elevated during the day.  

# Ear laceration:
On the day prior to discharge, the patient sustained a small 
laceration in the left outer ear canal from external trauma 
(likely injudicious Q tip use).  ENT evaluated his ear and 
confirmed that there was no eardrum perforation.  He should 
complete a 5 day course of Ciprofloxacin otic drops BID and 
follow-up with ENT as needed.    

# ___:
# Oliguric ATN:
# Elevated lambda light chain:
Cr WNL on admission, peaked at 3.7 on ___. Renal consulted and 
urine sediment suggestive of ATN, with likely culprit 
hypotension from overdiuresis. Low suspicion for 
contrast-nephropathy, interstitial process, or antibiotic 
toxicity. Renal U/S without obstruction. Mildly elevated lambda 
light chain could be consistent with MGUS. Slowly improved back 
to his baseline of 1.2 by the time of discharge.  As above, he 
was discharged on newly initiated Furosemide 80 mg PO BID, to be 
titrated by PCP or cardiology.  

# Lower extremity / scrotal edema:
# Anasarca:
# Hypoalbuminemia:
# Severe protein-calorie malnutrition:
Patient with significant scrotal and lower extremity edema in 
setting of hypoalbuminemia, with likely contributions from 
now-resolving oliguric ATN, cirrhosis, and tumor extension into 
the portal veins with associated tumor thrombus. LENIs negative 
for DVT.  This was thought to be less likely due to CHF 
predominantly given absence of overt pulmonary edema and nl TTE 
and more likely due to hypoalbuminemia, portal hypertension, and 
oliguric ATN.  Rate of diuresis was limited by symptomatic 
hypotension; IV furosemide was given with IV albumin to allow 
further diuresis, and he was diuresed down to a weight of 172 
lbs at discharge.  OF NOTE, his new dry weight is very likely 
lower than this, as he is now below his pre-admission dry weight 
of 173-179 lbs, and he still has a mild amount of pitting lower 
extremity edema.  He was discharged on furosemide 80 mg PO BID 
to be titrated in the outpatient setting.  Regarding his 
hypoalbuminemia and malnutrition, he will need to continue 
nectar thick liquids/pureed solids until his next SLP 
re-evaluation, and should receive nutritional supplementation as 
able. 

# Normocytic anemia:
# Thrombocytopenia:
Hgb 7.8 on admission from b/l of ___, likely secondary to anemia 
of chronic disease. S/p 1u pRBC on ___, with appropriate bump, 
but subsequently downtrended to 6.7 on ___, with appropriate 
bump to additional 1u prBC. He had episodes of scant hematuria 
but generally this remained stable in the ___ range; hgb was 7.3 
at discharge.  He may require periodic transfusions in the 
future.  Plts were 97 at discharge; this was attributed to his 
poor nutritional status and recent critical illness.  Fibrinogen 
was normal and smear without schistocytes, arguing against DIC.  
He was continued on apixiban as there was no clinically evident 
bleeding.  
 
# Coronary artery disease s/p CABG: 
# NSTEMI:
No history of angina for years on medically optimized regimen.  
No clear acute coronary syndrome to account for current 
presentation and with EKG showing no acute ischemic changes 
(nonspecific lateral ST depressions) with slight troponin leak
(peaked at ~0.13) more likely attributable to demand ischemia 
than an acute
coronary event. TTE with normal EF, no WMAs, and resolved RV 
dysfunction.  He was continued on aspirin, atorvastatin was 
increased to 81mg daily, home isosorbide and ranolazine were 
held to minimize hypotension in absence of angina, and his 
metoprolol was reduced from succinate 50 mg PO BID to 50 mg PO 
QD. 

# Cirrhosis (presumed NASH) w/ascites:
# Hepatocellular carcinoma w/extension to b/l portal vein:
# Portal vein tumor thrombosis:
Patient w/HCC in setting of radiographic cirrhosis (presumed 
NASH) with extension into portal veins with associated portal 
vein tumor thrombus. Followed by Dr. ___, but 
does not appear to have hepatologist. No varices on EGD in ___, 
mild ascites on imaging (without c/f SBP), no e/o hepatic 
encephalopathy; synthetic function appears intact. Being treated 
with nivolumab with palliative intent, C3D1 ___. Had 
evidence of ascites ___, but does not appear to have been on 
Lasix/spironolactone for volume management. Now with clear 
evidence of total-body volume overload; however, as he responded 
adequately to furosemide alone, spironolactone was not added at 
discharge to minimize risk of hypotension. 

# Atrial fibrillation:
He remains in afib with HRs well controlled.  His apixiban was 
continued, and metoprolol was dose-reduced to succinate 50 mg PO 
QD.  

# Urinary retention:
# Urinary incontinence:
# BPH:
Patient with hx of BPH, on tamsulosin and finasteride. Developed 
urinary retention w/? overflow incontinence after foley 
discontinuation on ___. Possible contributors are 
constipation, scrotal edema, and inability to receive tamsulosin 
(which cannot be crushed). Concern that bladder scanning was 
inaccurate in
setting of edema, however, as patient was bladder scanned ___ 
for >500cc and straight cathed for 200cc. Given need for 
accurate I/Os to facilitate diuresis, Foley was replaced on 
___ and remained in place at the time of discharge.  Urology 
follow-up was scheduled, and he should have a voiding trial 
attempted in the next ___ days.  He was continued on home 
finasteride; has not been receiving tamsulosin,
as it cannot be crushed, and received an aggressive bowel 
regimen to address constipation.  

# Hematuria:
# Hx urothelial cancer:
Scant hematuria noted on ___, likely secondary to foley 
placement.  No evidence of clots.  He was scheduled for 
outpatient urology follow-up.

# DM2:
A1c 7.5% on ___. His home linagliptin and glimepiride were held 
while in-house and he was maintained on weight-based insuliun.  
His home diabetes medicatiosn were resumed at discharge.  
 
# GERD:
lansoprazole in place of home omeprazole

# Anxiety:
# Depression:
contionued home duloxetine and diazepam

# Goals of care:
Discussed at length with patient on ___ and ___ given his 
frustration with his lengthy hospitalization. Shared with Mr. 
___ his family - wife ___ and daughter ___ that 
Mr. ___ has multiple ___ and active malignancy 
being treated with palliative intent. His renal function is 
recovering, but he has gross anasarca restricting his mobility 
and diuresis has been limited by hypotension. We outlined the 
two possibilities: 1) remain in the hospital to attempt diuresis 
and facilitate mobility and rehab potential vs 2) transition to 
a
comfort-oriented approach with liberalization of his diet 
restrictions, which may help him leave the hospital sooner and 
enjoy his meals but would likely mean being bedbound and 
contracting a recurrent pneumonia. Mr. ___ expressed an 
understanding of these choices. As much as he would like to be 
home, he recognizes that his ___ wife cannot care for 
him and that he will likely need institutional care of some 
type. He stated that his goal is to be able to walk again, and 
he therefore opted to pursue rehab placement.  His wife and 
daughter are in agreement and want aggressive medical treatment 
to facilitate rehab. Code status is confirmed
DNR/DNI. Of note, a feeding tube (for aspiration) had reportedly 
been
discussed by patient's oncologist (Dr. ___ and is not 
within 
patient's GOC.  The patient was diuresed cautiously (given 
hypotension and ___ and discharged on an oral regimen to be 
titrated by cardiology or PCP.   

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- PLEASE OBTAIN A STANDING WEIGHT ON THIS PATIENT EVERY SINGLE 
DAY.  If his weight is increasing by more than 3 pounds in a day 
or more than 5 pounds in a week, please have MD evaluate him for 
additional diuresis.
- Patient has a moderate amount of pitting lower extremity edema 
at the time of discharge, as well as acute venous stasis 
dermatitis.  His edema is likely multifactorial: 
hypoalbuminemia, HFpEF, and portal hypertension from his tumor 
thrombus are all likely contributing.  Ability to diurese as an 
inpatient was limited by symptomatic hypotension, and that 
overdiuresis led to renal dysfunction and ATN.  As such, the 
patient was diuresed carefully down to below his pre-admission 
dry-weight; however, still with significant edema, indicating 
his actual dry weight is likely now lower than before.  As he 
tolerated Furosemide 80 mg PO QD without electrolyte 
abnormalities or hypotension and remained slightly net negative 
on this, he was discharged on Furosemide 80 mg PO BID to achieve 
slow/gentle diuresis as an outpatient.  This will need to be 
further titrated at rehab; call PCP or cardiology if the 
patient's weight goes up by more than 5 pounds in a week or 3 
pounds in a day.  
- Patient with new diagnosis of HFpEF; needs outpatient 
cardiology evaluation - appointment was pending at the time of 
discharge
- Patient with evidence of likely undiagnosed COPD; needs 
outpatient pulmonary evaluation and PFTs - appointment made

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was our pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital with 
shortness of breath.  We found that this was due to a 
combination of pneumonia, a flare of your COPD, and too much 
fluid in your lungs.  The pneumonia may have been due to food 
going down the wrong pipe (a condition called ""aspiration""), for 
which our speech language pathologists recommended a modified 
diet for you.  You will get your swallowing function re-tested 
in the future and your diet will be advanced as you are able to 
tolerate.

We also found that you have a new diagnosis of congestive heart 
failure.  This caused too much fluid to accumulate in your lungs 
and in your legs.  We gave you medications to remove this fluid; 
gradually, the amount of swelling in your legs decreased.  Also 
while you were here, your kidney function was temporarily 
decreased, but it recovered back to its previous level.

Finally, you had difficulty emptying your bladder, so a catheter 
was placed in your bladder to help you urinate.  This should be 
removed in the next several days.   

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.

Pertinent Results:
Echo ___:
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo 
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left 
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial 
appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is severe symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal 
(LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricle displays normal free wall 
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are 
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple 
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the 
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve 
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. 
There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent 
with Lambl's excresences (normal variant). There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. ___ 
was notified in person of the results in the operating room at 
the time of the study.
POST BYPASS The patient is atrially paced. There is normal right 
ventricular systolic function. The left ventricle displays mild 
global hypokinesis and moderate inferior wall hypokinesis. The 
left ventricular ejection fraction is about 40%. There is no 
change in valvular function. The thoracic aorta is intact after 
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted and taken to the operating room on 
___ where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x5. 
Please see operative note for surgical details. In summary he 
had: 1.  Coronary artery bypass graft x 5, four arterial grafts 
using bilateral internal mammary arteries and one long saphenous 
vein graft.
2.  Skeletonized left internal mammary artery to left anterior 
descending artery.
3.  Skeletonized free right internal mammary artery sequential 
grafting to the ramus, ramus 2 and obtuse marginal arteries.
4.  Long saphenous vein graft to posterior left ventricular 
branch.
5.  Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.
He tolerated the surgery well and post-operatively he was taken 
to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. ICU 
course was complicated by prolonged intubation due secretions, 
and hypoxia. He failed trial extubation due to inability to 
manage his secretions and was reintubated. He then was 
aggressively diuresed with Lasix infusion. He was febrile and 
started on empiric antibiotics for possible PNA, however 
cultures were negative and antibx were stopped. Due to prolonged 
intubation, tube feedings were initiated via a dobhoff tube. 
Once extubated successfully on POD#9, he was delirious, 
agitation, and confusion and was managed with Ativan prn. Of 
note, he was taking Clonazepam at home prior to admission. He 
was evaluated by psychiatry per his family's request. Psychiatry 
recommended stopping clonazepam, adequately treating pain and 
giving consistent messages regarding plan of care. By the time 
of discharge his delirium was significantly improved.  
 His hospital course was further complicated by acute kidney 
injury and hypernatremia. At the time of discharge his creat was 
trending back toward baseline, his sodium remained elevated and 
he was receiving free water via dophoff tube. He was noted to 
cough with liquids. He was evaluated by speech and swallow team 
and the following was recommended: nectar thick liquids and 
pureed solids and meds crushed in apple sauce. 1:1 supervision. 
His chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac 
surgery protocol without complication. On POD 10 he was 
transferred to the stepdown floor for continued care and 
recovery. He worked with nursing and physical therapy to 
increase his strength and conditioning.  
 Physical therapy recommended a short stay at rehabilitation 
upon discharge. On POD#16 he was transferred to ___ 
___ in ___ in stable condition. All appointments and 
instructions were advised and provided to the rehab facility.
